My God , this stuff is great !


Used on my extremely painful shoulder and within minutes felt relief .


( I thought it might be the Advil I had taken earlier kicking in )


However , several days later , had a flare with joint pain in wrist .


Squeezed out a few drops and rubbed it in and pain relief was almost immediate .


I read that this is prescribed for knee pain but my doctor gave me a sample because the voltaren has worked ok for me and I can ' t take Advil a lot because of the gastro effects .


Boy , I love this stuff and will ask for a script next time I see the Rheumy .

I took 10 mg / day of Lipitor for 6 years .


It worked perfectly and made my blood test numbers for cholesterol , HDL / LDL and Triglycerides look textbook perfect .


A few of the symptoms I listed ( mostly muscular ) quickly appeared when I began the Lipitor and became slowly more intense and more of them came into the picture as each year passed .


I stopped the Lipitor recently out of desperation and most all symptoms improved greatly within days of stopping .


I do not plan to resume it and will find some other way to control things .


My Grandmother is in the hopital with side affect of a storke , the Dr now think that it could be a reaction to Lipitor that she has been taking .

Doc put me on Lipitor , when I complained that Tricor was making me tired .


Lipitor was 10 X WORSE ! ! ! .


I WILL NEVER TAKE ANY STATIN EVER AGAIN ! !


Since I found this site - - I thought all the symptoms were caused by other things .


Now I know that Tricor started the problems , Lipitor made them much worse .

As posted previously ( search on 269 ) , I have been on a program of 12 , 000 mg . / day of vitamin C for three months in an effort to lower my cholesterol , and it is having a positive effect .


My cholesterol has dropped from 269 to 240 .


I now have increased my intake of Vitamin C to 16 , 000 mg / day , and we ' ll see how this works out .


ALL of the negative side effects of Lipitor have disappeared ( only took 5 months ) , and I ' m optimistic about the Vitamin C .


Be afraid , be very afraid .


Started on lipitor about 6 months ago .


2 - 3 weeks ago I went to MD with sore neck / arms ( especially left ) feeling of breathlessness and anxiety , feeling like something was going to happen .

Do your research .

After third dose pain was so severe I could hardly move .
3,3 ADR|8,10 ADR

I stopped Lipitor .


The doctor recommended laying off Lipitor for a week and then restarting .


NO WAY !


The pain has gradually subsided but it has not disappeared over a period of several months .

7,9 ADR|12,19 ADR

It doesn ' t seem to matter what foods I eat , I always get distention and gas while on this drug .
15,15 ADR|17,17 ADR

This is an unpleasant ( for everyone near me ) side effect .


Since my Dr is out of town , and I ' ve only been on the medication for 6 weeks ( 10 mg ) , I ' m stopping it until I get in to see her .


I ' ve also had very different cholesterol readings over the years , and am skeptical that any given time you go in for a blood test , it could be very different .


It ' s just that my last one was high ( 275 ! ) But sometimes it ' s 170 .


And it ' s also been borderline for many years , around 200 .


( with the good cholesterol very good ) .


I think it ' s higher these days , because I ' ve been in menopause longer .


But I wonder if side effects to any drug aren ' t a message that .


Nagging muscle pain between and just below my shoulder blades , persistent fatigue , moderate insomnia , increasingly unable to focus or stay .
0,9 ADR|11,12 ADR|14,15 ADR|18,20 ADR

I took 20 mg / day for over four years before the totality of the side effects and their likely root cause finally hit me over the head .


The adverse effects were insidiously gradual in their development which kept the alarm bells from going off sooner .


Like many , I attributed each individual symptom to .


Muscle pain in left elbow , pain in feet .
0,4 ADR|6,8 ADR

After reading all these comments I ' ve come to the conclusion that I too have suffered the effects of this drug and will not take again .


I ' m very curious if these affects can be reversed .


So glad I happened upon this website .


I have done very well with Lipitor for the last 2 1 / 2 years .


It has reduced my cholesterol significantly - from over 300 to under 150 .


Two weeks ago I was given the new generic .


This week I noticed that all my fingers and toes were tingling , a pins and needles feeling .
7,11 ADR|14,17 ADR

It was like they had fallen asleep .


I immediately went back to pharmacy and got brand name again ( luckily my insurance pays - it will be $ 15 / 3 month supply more , but it ' s worth it ) .


I have noticed just within the last two days the tingling is gone .
10,10 ADR

Thank goodness !


I read that generics have the same active ingredients , but there may be a difference in how the medicine is released .


It ' s not EXACTLY the same .


High cholesterol runs in my family and I am greatful that Lipitor can help me manage this .


Brain fog and decreased cognitive skills .

The stomach pain comes and goes and can become quite uncomfortable .
1,2 ADR

No side effects .


My doctor ( conservative and top - rate ) says that taking Lipitor is a no brainer .


All advantages , no disadvantages .


And for me that ' s true .


My cholesterol fell to 160 and I ' ve had no side effects .


My husband and I buy 20 mg tablets and use pill - splitter to cut in half .


Costs much less ! .

I cut the dose from 10 mg to 5 mg and reduced above side effects by about 40 % .


Surprised when I found others had similar symptoms .


Took 10 mg of Lipitor for 6 weeks and dropped my cholesterol from 310 down to 225 .


Mentioned how I felt and was directed to cut the dose in half .

I ' m seeing my doctor today and looking into natural cures - 3000 to 6000 mg .


Vitamin C daily , Lysine , Vitamins A & E .


Read about Dr Linus Pauling on - line and his findings about Vitamin C .


He won a Nobel Prize for his research .


Reduced choloesterol levels significantly but side effects are not worth it .


I like to have a glass of wine with my dinner but with this drug , I ' m concerned in addition to the side effects I ' ve just started experiencing .


None noticable .


No side effects noted while taking a 40 mg dose each day .


Good Medication - Overall cholesterol dropped from 284 to 174 in one month .


none I can attribute directly to the medication .


One must follow liver function tests ( e . g . SGOT , SGPT ) to insure no significant injury to liver cells .


My liver enzymes elevated after 3 months and then doubled after another three months .

2,5,8,8 ADR|2,5,10,10 ADR|2,6 ADR|13,13 ADR|18,19 ADR

My docter wanted me to keep taking the drug but I know this is another drug that will follow in the footsteps of HRT therapy .


We were getting it to lessen our chances of heart attacks and instead it was found to increase the risk .


With TV advertisements , the drug company is hyping a dangerous drug .


I wonder how many people will become seriously ill before they pull if off the market .


DON ' T TAKE ANY STATIN DRUGS .

Saw an internist and 2 neurolgists , had MRI , MRA , all showing nothing .


Stopped Lipitor 2 weeks ago , with 40 % reduction in severity but still waiting for it to go away .


Not many here have posted follow - up .


Because so many people take Lipitor , and headaches , etc are so coommon , what we need is to show that there is an increased incidence of side effects like these compared to those not taking Lipitor , AND that the side effects go away once stopping it .


I will re - post when either 3 months goes by or the side effects disappear , whichever is 1 st .


I suspect that it will take at least a few more weeks , before the build - up effects of this mess can be cleared from my brain .


I thought I was having a heart attack - went to emergency room .


Problem began while sitting at this computer .

By the time I arrived at the hospital I was shaking with chills uncontrollably .
10,13 ADR

After tests were run I was told that it wasn ' t a heart attack or shroke .


They said it was probably related to stress or a panic attack - - ridiculous because I haven ' t been stressed and have never had any problem similar .


Definitely helped lower my cholesterol from 263 to 164 - - amazing , but I ' m afraid to continue taking due to experiencing same severe side effects .


Will discuss further with my doctor .


Kidney failure , difficulty swallowing , persistent pain in calf and knee , short term memory loss , peripheral neuropathy , constipation , sleep disturbance , mood change , rage .

I ' m hoping that there is not any perminent damage .


While first taking lipitor and I noticed these changes I told my doctor and he told me that this had nothing to do with the lipitor .


It was just age .


After being on 10 mg of Lipitor for about 3 years , I started to experience speech and swallowing problems which got worse while I continued to take it as recommended by my physician .
16,16,19,19 ADR|18,19 ADR

After 6 months , my speech and swallowing were so bad that I stopped the Lipitor .

So , I really believe in this drug , but must consider what it may be doing to my body and my degree of pain .

It took a while ( months ) before I started to feel normal again .


Heartburn and stomach upset .
0,0 ADR|2,3 ADR

It seems to be working pretty well .


I still have pain but less severe .


I have been somewhat concerned about taking this drug for so long due to the possible side effects , but my Dr checks me out ( blood work , etc ) every four months and I seem to be doing allright .


I don ' t want to get started on stronger , possibly habit forming drugs .


I was prescribed Zipsor for bone and joint pain associated with Lupus .


I also have 3 herniated discs that have been bothering me for years , and for which I have always taken a low dose of Vicodin ( almost daily ) .


The Zipsor works well on the Lupus pain , but also almost completely wiped out the pain from the herniated discs , and has replaced my usual narcotic pain relief for my back .


As with any disc issues there seems to be the occasional flare up , but when they do occur now they are minor , and once I take my usual dose of Zipsor , the pain is gone again .


I have had no recognizable side effects .

0,4 ADR|6,6 ADR|8,12 ADR

DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG ! ! ! ! ! ! ! .


I was put on this drug by my doctor for my somewhat high cholesterol .


The next day , after starting this drug , I suddenly felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight but did not connect it to starting Lipitor .
11,20 ADR

Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age , by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years .
41,48 ADR

I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped .


My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled .


So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem .


I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor , unfortunately .


Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office .


So I did and the next day , after taking only one pill , I was eighty years old again .
14,18 ADR

This time I did associate it with the start of Lipitor and then read the warnings the drug store gives you with meds and found that my symptoms were the same as what they warned against .


I am not a hypochondriac and I never read those warnings so this was not a head thing .


I immediately went off the drug but a year later I am still have the same eighty years old feeling and do not know that I will ever be normal again .
16,19 ADR

I do not understand how just one pill can do that and this time I am not recovering like I did the first time .


This has ruined my life and I would never have taken Lipitor if I knew what I know now and I am so sorry that I ever heard of this drug .


This is so severe that I think taking it for even a short time can cause permanent damage .


My doctor , when I told him of all this , wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol .


I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zetia , which he said was was less effective but was not a statin , which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor .


He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said , well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect , but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed .


I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up !


I advise , DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG ! ! ! ! ! .


muscle aches in legs .
0,3 ADR

I tried 10 mg a day for 6 days but developed muscle pain in legs .
11,14 ADR

Doctor is now putting me on 10 mg once a week to see if I can tolerate that dosage .


Thanks to all you guys for a heads - up on what can happen with this drug as it is nice not to be blindsided by the medical community .


Thanks again to everybody who posts here ! ! .


None Maybe I ' m just lucky .


I went from 80 mg zocor to 40 then 80 mg lipitor all with no discernible side effects .


Without statins my TC is around 300 , with 80 mgm lipitor it is a consistent 140 .


Nothing else worked to bring it down and I nearly died with 99 % blockage of the LAD before an angioplasty and going on statins .


Both my grandfather and father dropped dead in their early sixties .

my partner is currently taking this medication liptor , he also takes high blood pressure medication , my reason for initally looking for side effects of liptor was because of my partners decreased libido and to see if there is a connection between this and the medication , however i noticed a small number of people are suffering in this way , i cannot believe the amount of things that are causing such a big problem for so many people taking this drug , my partner is normally very muscular as works out twice a week and has done for years , but over the last 6 mths or so seems to have lost a lot of muscle and replacedit with fat , especially around the midrif , he also suffers from regular dioreaha and muscle pain in back and just below shoulder blades , very often also suffers from headaches , doesnt sleep very well at night at all , also gets tired a lot , my partner isnt aware of this website but i will be definetly showing this to him and advising him to perhaps stop taking this medication for a few weeks to see what the difference is , so glad to have found this site .

He put me on another statin after a month of not taking Lipitor and the same thing started to happen .


I am now taking herbs for my cholesterol and it is still high but going lower and my feet are doing better .


Drug co should inform doctors of these problems so they will understand them when their patients come to them for help and .

Cholesterol plays an important role in brain and nerve function and is essential to our good overall health .


Do your research .


Stripping your body of it can be devastating .

I stopped taking Lipitor for about a week and felt somewhat better , Christmas over by then , once again I considered stress as the cause and not Lipitor .


I went back on Lipitor about a week ago and feel horrible again .

14,14 ADR|16,16 ADR

I left it at home by accident when we went on vacation and within 3 days , the pain in my legs began to go away .
18,21 ADR

After 2 weeks I knew it was a very dangerous medication .


I went to my new physician and he wanted me to try Pravachol .


Afer 4 days on it , I was in a fog and thought I had the flu .


I have been off it for just 36 hours and feel better .


I am an RN and should have known that I was experiencing side effects with Lipitor , but you listen to your Doctor because you trust him .


I now tell my patients to trust what their bodies are telling them .


Statins can ' t be good for anyone but the drug companies ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !


They keep lowering the recommended levels so that almost everyone is considered to have high cholesterol .


If someone is 30 and on this for 30 or 40 years there is not telling what the long term effects will be .


And a mi .

Hike , play golf and keep busy .


It is a terrible drug and should be off the market .


The lipitor works for lowering cholestrol levels .


However , I wonder if there is a corolation between lipitor ( statins ) and restless legs syndrome ( rls ) .


I ' ve talked with a couple others that have rls and they are on lipitor too .


Does anyone taking lipitor experience rls ?


I ' ll check back here for the results .

0,5 ADR|7,12 ADR|14,15 ADR

Before I was put on Lipitor for high cholesterol , I had an echo done , normal results .

23,26 ADR

Plus my right ventricular was mildly dilated .
2,6 ADR

Also I had elevated calcium in my blood test .
3,4 ADR

never did I have that prior to taking Lipitor .


My dr . said diastolic dysfunction can come from age .
4,5 ADR

I am only 53 yrs old !


I have low blood pressure , I do not have coronary artery disease , I am not a diabetic .

I took Pravachol and Zocor before Lipitor - cardiologist increased dose of Lipitor to 40 mg and 80 mg .


The last 4 years of my life have been a physical and mental nightmare .


As soon as stopped Lipitor immediately felt much better but degenerative back disease ( MD said was due to aging ) is still severe but improving somewhat .
10,12 ADR

Statins destroyed my life , I am certain of .


dosage was increased from 10 to 20 mg and the tingling and numbness in my feet and shins escalated .
10,10,13,15 ADR|10,10,13,14,17,17 ADR|12,15 ADR|12,14,17,17 ADR

I even went to a podiatrist because my toes ached and my feet hurt .

10,11 ADR|13,20 ADR|31,33 ADR

I think these drugs really screwed me up .


Don ' t use statin drugs .


they are very dangerous ! ! .


Possibly diarrhea and stomach pain , but most likely none because I am taking this with a nasty antibiotic for a sinus infection that definitely causes diarrhea and nausea .
1,1 ADR|26,26 ADR|3,4 ADR|28,28 ADR

I was supposed to take it 2 x / day for 7 days and then 2 x / day as needed .


I completed the 7 days and then did not take it on the 8 th day .


The pain was immediately worse than before taking Voltaren .


It does help the pain in my knee , which is a strained meniscus , but I ' m afraid that the drug is masking the pain which enables me to overexert my joints and cause more injury .


This really makes me nervous .


I am going to speak with my doctor about this possibility .


If I take the pill on an empty stomach I get a very faint sensation of queasiness .
16,16 ADR

almost to faint to notice .


However , I also get diarrhoea at least twice a day .
5,5 ADR

There are no gas pains and no other symptoms , so it ' s inconvenient more than anything else .
3,4 ADR

When I am on holiday at the coast I am pain free , mostly , so don ' t take any Arthrotec , but when I get back to a drier climate the pain is severe , so Arthrotec is very important to me and my quality of life .


It also allows me to sleep .

0,0 ADR|4,5 ADR|7,9 ADR

Returned to normal within a week of quitting Lipitor .


I had rather risk living with a 228 cholesterol level than deal with the memory loss .
14,15 ADR

It was quite frightening as it seemed like incipient dementia .


Was doing fine on it for years .


I unfortunately was diagnosed with Colin cancer and had to start chemotherapy .


The combo of chemo and Lipitor caused my liver enzymes to rise , muscle and joint stiffness as well as sore ribs .

I am an unlikely candidate for MND .


I know the Lipitor poisoned me .


I wish I had stopped taking this poison before it caused permanent nerve damage .
11,13 ADR

I don ' t seem to have any side effects .

I can ' t sleep on either shoulder now .
1,7 ADR

My lower back is also tight again !
1,5 ADR

And I get terrible headaches from the tight neck muscles .
3,4 ADR|7,9 ADR

I googled muscle pain and Lipitor showed up on the first 6 or 7 entries ! !


I read all the comments on this page and couldn ' t believe it ! !


I see my symptoms over and over !


So , I had blood tests done this week and have elevated creatine so was told today to stop Lipitor immediately , and will see my doctor next week .
11,12 ADR

After reading all these comments , I have no doubt that Lipitor is the cause of all this discomfort .
18,18 ADR

I just hope and pray that I can recover from these terrible side effects .


I will use vitamin C and other natural things to help my cholesterol .


but if that doesn ' t help .


hey .


I ' d rather die from a heart attack than die a slow painful death on Lipitor .


I think drugs are released on the market these days without enough long - term clinical studies to make sure they are safe .


I started taking Lipitor after my cholesterol climbed to 310 .


I Did not want to take it because I am a vegetarian , a health conscious person and dislike taking medicines , but my doctor , an endocrynologist , strongly recommended it .


The first few months I was not aware of any side effects , but about a month ago I started to experience wrist pain , I thought it was my pilates class , but although I rested for 2 months from the class , the pain continued .
22,23 ADR|45,45 ADR

Then about two weeks ago , I got very bad cramps in my toes , they curled down and the pain was terrible .
10,10 ADR|20,20 ADR

About a week ago I was taking a bath and my muscles in my lower abdomen started to contract then the cramp got higher .
11,11,21,21 ADR|11,18 ADR

I got scared that I was having something bad .


After the cramps one night I had such tiredness in my left leg that I could hardly walk , I thought that it was my high heels that I had worn all day .
2,2 ADR|8,9,12,12 ADR|15,17 ADR

Then 2 days ago I woke up with a swollen foot , it was very painful to walk .
9,10 ADR|15,17 ADR

That was it .


I suspected that it was the Lipitor and came to the internet and read the same side effects in a lot of people posting their experiences with this drug .


I even thought that I had ALS since a friend of mine died of it .


It is amazing the amount of people that also thought the same in this list .


Thanks God for the Internet .


I stopped taking this medicine 2 days ago , I hope that I can get rid of these effects and that they are not permanent .


I do not recommend it , unless it is life threatening and then only take it for a short time .


back ache , dizziness , leg cramps on exercise walk .
0,1 ADR|3,3 ADR|5,6 ADR

While these symptoms crept up on me over an 18 month period , I like many people assume it ' s an age thing .


I just turned 50 and family and friends would laugh about my forgetfulness .
12,12 ADR

The severity of that memory failure frightened me enough to do extensive research on Lipitor .
4,5 ADR

I stopped taking it the next day and within 72 hours my swelling decreased significantly , muscle aches and joint pain disappeared , memory loss is not as severe , breathing is easier , stamina is back etc
12,12 ADR|16,17 ADR|19,20 ADR|23,24 ADR

I mentioned these same things to my cousin who has since stopped taking it as well .


She can ' t thank me enough for giving her life back !

I am presently being tested for arthritus , but there is no history of arthritus in my family and I am just 61 .


The pain has been so intense that my life is being made a misery .
1,5 ADR

Will now stop taking Liptor having read the comments on this site and hope I recover .


Assuming Liptor is the culprit I am really annoyed with my doctor .


and will tell him so .


I went to him feeling totally OK nine months ago and he advised me to start taking this drug .


Better to live ten years feeling OK and then drop dead of a heart attack , rather than commit suicide to escape the intense pain caused by a prescribed drug .

It works for reducing cholesterol levels , but after 6 years I ' m increasingly wondering about the side effects and looking for alternatives .


After taking lipitor for 1 week , my resting pulse jumped to between 100 and 105 , and I started experiencing dizziness , lack of energy ( tireness ) , and unexplained sweating .
21,21 ADR|23,25 ADR|31,32 ADR|8,15 ADR

The doctor said these were not listed as known possible side effects .


But after one ( 1 ) month my resting pulse had jumped to about 120 and the dizziness has become both more frequent and more pronounced .
17,17 ADR|8,14 ADR

Have discontinued lipitor and will not take it for 1 month to see if symptoms disappear .


Other symptoms which started occurring after a few days of lipiltor include sever leg muscle pain , swelling of the lower legs and feet , and even more sudden and pronounced sweating at random , unexplained times .
13,15 ADR|17,17 ADR|30,31 ADR

My physical ( 6 days before starting the lipitor ) was perfectly normal except for the cholestorol which had jumped from 175 to 220 , primarily due to changed job / work conditions / diet / lack of exercise .


Have appointment to see doctor again next week .


And will discuss further with her .


There has been some increase in jo .


I discussed lipitor with two friends who are both teaching pharmacologists .


BOTH had heard similar stories about lipitor and they had each heard of all of these symptoms being connected with it ( FWIW , I have a large number of hypersensitivities to several other drugs [ as well as to alcohol ] , so this was not a big surprise to me . ) .

I would much rather put up with my debilitating chronic knee pain ( waiting for surgery ) than to ever take another pill .


I spent $ 100 on the stupid pills - what an utter & complete waste of money .


Have been on Lipitor 3 months .


It did lower my cholesterol from 215 to 168 .


However , I had been feeling more fatigued and now I am getting severe shoulder , neck and back pain .

Now my feet are getting sore .

It works for cholesterol , but I feel like a truck hit me .

I feel horrible .


Horrific medication - Suffered an acute pancreatic attack with critical blood levels that almost caused my death .

My entire body was " shutting " down .

My blood reports were at critical levels , BP was very low 98 / 60 , fever for over 6 weeks , weight loss of 10 lbs . , yellow color to my skin , couldn ' t walk straight , prostate infection , sweating , nausea , pain in stomach & back , urination effected , hoarseness / coughing , heart racing , disoriented .

Then the doctor in charge left us floundering on our own , going from one specialist after another to counter what was happening .


My children did some research on the web about my drugs that I was taking , which included Voltaren , and learned about the adverse reactions to this drug and I stopped Voltaren .


The specialists agreed with this conclusion , since they were exact to my problems .


My body reacted and I recovered gradually .


My advice to all - STOP - Find something else .


I lost 2 months of my life and I still don ' t remember the entire e .
13,16 ADR

If you are taking this drug - Make absolutely sure that you get blood work done every 6 months , in order to catch any critical levels in your blood .


Then - STOP - the drug .

After about 4 months of taking Lipitor , one day while walking , my left leg , below the knee , experienced intense pain and stiffness .

Symtoms have persisted for a week and after reading the comments on this board , I am stopping it .


While it worked well by lowering my cholesterol , I had no idea this was a side affect .


Works just fine .


If there are any side effects , they are definitely not noticeable .


What ' s with all these older people ( 70 ' s ) complaining about the lack of sex drive ?


Are you guys being realistic ?


How much of what you are complaining about is simply related to getting older ? .

15,17 ADR|23,23 ADR

Under doctor ' s orders am to wait for full muscle recovery , then try again at 1 / 2 dosage .


if pain returns I will have to seek other alternatives besides Lipitor .

The drug did knock my cholesteral down by 55 % , so I have motivation to try and make it work .

Nobody ever said anything about all these side affects .


But have been complaining to my Dr for a while now of terrible muscle pain and nothing was mentioned that it could be Lipitor .
12,14 ADR

Been tested for everything from malaria to lupus .


Was always physically fit and not overweight and maintained an active lifestyle but this has sapped every ounce of energy I have and can ' t do much of anything anymore .


Have an appointment with my Dr in a few days and I will be bringing a printout of this site .


There are other people who are suffering just like me .


Now I know what the hell is wrong and will be off Lipitor .


My quaility of life has suffered too long on this garbage .


Thank God I found this site .


took celebrex 8 - 1 / 2 years .


when it stopped working my primary physician put me on arthrotec 75 twice a day .


less convenient than the celebrex as twice per day instead of once per day .


otherwise as reported by other comments there is occassional joint pain from increased physical activity .


Muscle twitching , stiff neck , constant lightheadedness , always worrying about a brain tumor or something .
0,1 ADR|3,4 ADR|7,7 ADR|9,10 ADR

I found this site and it looks like my problems may be the Lipitor .


Doctor refering me to a nuerologist for twitching and light head .

0,1 ADR|3,3 ADR

Went off them cold turkey early May and rededicated myself to a low carb / paleo diet .


Now focusing on TRIG / HDL ratio , TRIGlyceride levels , and keeping blood sugar in acceptable range .


Ratios and numbers have significantly improved and weight has dropped another 15 lbs although LDL has gone up ( probably due to increase in dietary saturated fats ) .


Will retest ( out of pocket ) in a few months to see if my numbers improve .


Fatigue and laziness is gone and afternoon energy levels are high ( as indicated by no yawning ! ) .

Called my Doctor and told him about my symptoms .


He said it sounded like I had a virus .


He told me to go off lipitor for two weeks and then try it again .


I have no intention of taking lipitor again .


Just now starting to feel somewhat normal again after being off it for one week .


However , I have now developed a sore throat .

I had the first vaginal bleeding , a lot of pruritus and my skin was all red but I didn ' t know it was arthrotec .
4,5 ADR|10,10 ADR|13,16 ADR

My doctor prescribed me a topical cream , did some vaginal test to exclude infections .


I had my cycle The last one for 4 days .


More problems and this time I had the idea to go on Internet and I discovered I had a lot of the side effects by taking Arthrotec .


I have not clinically proved my theory yet , but I strongly believe that taking Lipitor for 4 years ended up giving me Multiple Sclerosis .

I am a 37 yr old male , I was diagnosed with MS two months ago .
12,12 ADR

My cholesterol was it ' s highest at 212 when my GP prescribed the drug .


My total cholesterol while on it got down to 130 ish .


This is too low in my opinion and my body began attacking my CNS and now have to live with this .


Again , this has not yet proven , nor have i gone down that road yet .


Big Pharma wants to promote the use of statins to treat MS , when I stopped taking mine ( Jan 2010 ) that is when my symptoms became present ? ?


I may have been the human rat in that theory .


To make matters even worse , the therapy my neurologist wants to put me on , just so happens to be the same company that mfg . ' s Lipitor .


hmmm ! .

Why isn ' t this widely known ?


I ' m angry and also sad , sad that I ' ve wasted all this time and angry that the drug companies are getting richer by the second .


Some added gas / wind .

( Cont ' d - Pt . 4 ) , but don ' t cut your life short by raging against a drug that may be saving / extending lives of thousands like me .

Took vioxx , bextra , mobic and ultram with no relief .


Just started this and am optomistic it is helping so far .

First - WOW !


Second - okay I just started taking Lipitor yesterday - one dose in .


20 mg dose and will try for two months , if something happens sooner I ' ll stop before the two months are up .


What I am reading is that most doctors are NOT prescribing conservative dosages - maybe take that back to them the next appointment ?


Eh ?


My first night - the soundest sleep in over four years !


without pain killers for the constant trigeminal neuralgis ( a side benefit to be sure ) .


Not happy about the idea of statins - strange psychic events when my mother was taking them ( Zocor ) - too strange to repeat in a public forum .


So I am here looking for information about the side effects - anecdotally presented - as the web site for Lipitor does not have the information that would typically come on the drug sheet .


If anyone knows of a site that has the real skinny on Lipitor ' s effects - please pass it along .


Much appreciated ! .


became more anxious about EVERYTHING , and noticed words would not form in my head during conversations , was disturbing and couldn ' t figure out why these things were happening .
2,2 ADR|8,11 ADR

made me think i needed antidepressants or something to deal with constant anxiety / fear ( which i have taken before and are horrible to get off of ) have noticed slightly more tingling and weird pains , so I think this is a perfect time to stop taking this .
12,12 ADR|14,14 ADR|33,33 ADR|36,36 ADR

I agree with another post .


what are they doing to us , in the interest of healing us ?


I did take the actual lipitor for several yrs , and it did lower cholesteral , but started experiencing the muscle tingley thing and stopped , then started with the Atorvastatin , where i noticed the above side affects .

I spoke with my doctor just hours after taking this medication , i described all my symptoms , the bleeding was dismissed as being a coincedence and nothing to do with the medication ! !
