There is something really fishy about this drug .


I do not advise anyone to take it as there are many adverse side effects .

My Neurologist has prescribed Prednisone 10 mg to help with the symptoms .


I am trying to limit my use of the Predisone but cannot take care of basic functions without a minimum of 10 mg daily .


As a CEO of a large sales company and a physcially active person , I ' m extremely concerned about this chronic condition .

Be careful with this stuff .


Had a total cholesterol of about 230 .


saw results after first 3 months .


Had no other health concerns .


Exercised on a regular basis and am in very good shape .


This stuff grabbed me and ruined the this last year of my life .


I have no other risk factors for heart desease except a moderatly elevated cholesterol level , no family history or anything .


Thought I would take lipitor just to be safe .


Big mistake .


Went to my doctor and told him I wasn ' t going to take the lipitor any more .


Told him I was presenting with some very adverse signs and symptoms and the only thing that had ever changed was the fact i was on Lipitor .


He was not happy with my decision and offered a switch to a different statin , I declined .


He got aggitated and asked what articles I had been reading and where I got my information .


I told him I didn ' t need a medical journal to convince me this stuff was messing me up , I was living proof .


4 - 5 days after stopping the Lipitor it was like someonebrought the sun out .


Depression faded along with all the other psychological enigmas I was dealing with .

I am the advocate for my father who took this drug for 8 months before he passed from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2005 .


The patient data is reported for him by me .


Briefly , my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer ( glial cell related cancer ) .
26,33 ADR

That cancer was diagnosed 6 months after his initial Rx for Lipitor - - he died 2 months after his initial cancer diagnosis .
1,1 ADR|21,21 ADR

There were no warning signs , deterioration was very fast and debilitating - - he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards .


My father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old , had great cholesterol numbers , but he was a cardiac patient .


He and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 ( his lipid profile was very , very good by usual medical standards ) .


I will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen ( my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father ' s work history experience ) , but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this .


My father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a totally normal guy walking with a cane from initial neurological damage at inital dx for brain cancer to bedridden , unable to speak , feed himself , do anything for himself in 10 days .
11,12 ADR|30,31 ADR|36,37 ADR|39,39 ADR|41,42,45,46 ADR|41,43 ADR

Don ' t know if this will really help anybody - - but just please be cautious with Rx medicines and advocate for yourself ; you may not know everthing , but you do know best about what you are experiencing with these Rxs .


keep doing your research , tell your doctor anything you find relevent about your life as it relates to Rxs you are given , and advocate hard for your quality of life .

I do not have high blood pressure , nor have I ever had it .


I am not diabetic .


I am 45 and a half years old and was on 20 mg of Lipitor due to genetically high LDL for a period of seven months .


At that point , I started having terrible , migratory joint pain all over my body that was very distinct and pronounced .
7,15 ADR

I also had disabling fatigue and flu - like malaise .
3,4 ADR|6,9 ADR

Some nights I would go to bed at 6 pm and not get up until 8 or 9 the next morning .


I was quite ill .
2,3 ADR

My doctor did tons of lab work to rule out things like rheumatoid arthriitis , lupus , Lyme disease and active parvovirus infection .


These all came back NEGATIVE .


Finally , I was taken off Lipitor to see if the drug had anything to do with my symptoms .


Within 72 hours I noted an improvement ; within seven days , the symptoms were completely gone and I was restored to health .


I will not ever take Lipitor again as I believe it is liver - toxic and slowly poisons the patient .


It did a great job of lowering my LDL ( 173 down to 60 ) .


My total cholesterol went from 238 down to 143 .


However , it nearly killed me in the process and I believe it is almost like a slow - acting poison .


I have been concerned about long term effects of Arthrotec , but with chronic back for 9 years I cannot live without it right now .


I was shocked to read some of the comments on this website .


I never had any stomach trouble , or cramps , or anything people have mentioned here .


People mentioned Celebrex .


A friend of mine developed an ulcer after only a short time on Celebrex .


I do not have any kind of stomach trouble after 8 years .


Would I rather not take it ?


Of course , but I have to be able to get out of the bed in the morning .


I have blood work done every year to see if there ' s any kidney , liver damage or anything , and so far there hasn ' t been any .


I would recommend it .


I was fine for 3 weeks and then it felt like a neo - nazi skinhead gang kicked me in the gut 150 times .

I was on lowest dose .


My LDL started at 90 , but MD insisted that because I am diabetic , I should be on lipitor and try to get below 70 .


Lipitor knocked it down to 25 .


I do not know if the problems were due to Lipitor , or having LDL down to 25 .


I asked MD he stated They ( whomever they are ) , have not established a low threshold for what is safe .


I stated that just because it has not been proven in a lab , does not mean it is not true .


I went off the meds , and am now in search of a new MD , as I have felt worse under this DR care than ever before in my life .


very productive cough .

Unable to straighten it and doctors unable to find a reason for it .


Walked like that for about six months with increasing pain , especially in right thigh which felt .
9,9,12,14 ADR

I ' m so disillusioned with the drug companies and the FDA that I won ' t take anything my doctor recommends again .


Lipitor has robbed me and my family of my former active self and I have no idea whether I will ever return to normal .


Will try the CoQ 10 idea and also physical therapy to try to realign everything from my hips down so I can move normally again .


DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG !


IT IS NOT WORTH TRADING YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE FOR A LOWER CHOLESTEROL NUMBER ! ! !


I too would like to join a class action suit , as I feel Pfizer was well aware of the damage this drug could do .


Lethargy , fuzzy thinking , blurry vision , dull muscle pains constantly .
0,0 ADR|2,3 ADR|5,6 ADR|9,10 ADR

I fear stopping the lipitor because I fear a heart attack .


Bt I hate the side effects !


I take vitamin c , fish oil capsules , CO Q 10 , eat well , am allergic to red meat and have not eaten any in more than 35 years .


I eat salad everyday for lunch , eat fruit and vegetables daily , and take many vitamins and supplements ( astaxanthan , MSM , alpha lipoid acid , vit . B complex , 500 mg of time release Niacin , and more ) .


One would expect me to be healthy and have a ton of energy , but instead , I feel Ike I have one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel .


I attribute all the negatives to the Lipitor .


The worst of all the side effects is the horrible pain in my feet ( I have professionally prescribed orthotics in my shoes at all times ) .

After ten years of misery I stopped taking lipitor / atorvastatin , on the advice of my doctor , for a week to relieve severe shoulder pain , which I extended to ten days when I noticed an amazing improvement in my general well - being and after the ten days felt so much better I stopped taking it altogether .
25,26 ADR

For those who feel a long life is preferable to a good life , this drug may be worth taking ; for those who have enjoyed life and would prefer a slightly shorter one to a longer miserable one , stopping it is not a bad idea .

I can ' t remember how long I was on Lipitor ( maybe 8 - 10 months ) .


I was on Pravachol for 2 months when I ended up with similar problems .

I ' m appalled at the state of the cholesterol war .


My HDL has always been in the 60 ' s which put me at a ratio of 4 . 0 or better .


Dr . ' s used to say that was all that mattered .


NOW , my new Dr prescribes Lipitor as my numbers are ' alarming ' .

Within one day I felt the pain lessen .


I am now walking up the stairs 95 % normal and can actually walk through a mall without having to sit down every 5 minutes .

Agressive cholesterol management is my only option .


Liptor works .


I take 40 mgs / day , may be able to lower it since my total cholesterol dropped from 300 to 120 in two months .


My doctor put me on CoQ 10 at the same time as the Lipitor , and explained possible side effects .


Lipitor actually reversed blockages in one of my brothers .


4 out of 5 of us are on statins - 3 Lipitor .


No serious bad effects .


Try CoQ 10 to prevent / reduce side effects .


I didn ' t think I had any side effects until I started reading through some of the list of problems other people are having .

I went to the medical center today because I was feeling so bad .


I have Lupus so I assumed that it was causing me to feel bad .


After hearing my symptoms , my doctor told me to using Lipitor for awhile to see if the symptoms go away .


It never dawned on me that it could be the Lipitor .


Now that I found your website I feel so much better .


I did not experience any , but only took 1 tab once a day for two days .


I found that Voltaren took away all my pain , i rarely use pain relief because i find it never helps or takes too long to take affect and just " soldier on " .


As i am only young and relatively healthy i did not experience any side effects .


HOWEVER my parents both have had bad side effects .


so i dont recommend it if you suffer from High blood pressure , IBS , are prone to stomache ulcers , prone to reflux , heart burn or are an asthmatic .


Otherwise if like me you are healthy and just need pain relief when nothing else will cut it just take one a day , and dont stay on them .


the chances of getting side effects seem to increase according to the length of time you continue using them ( like most drugs ) and the effectiveness of the pain relief can also wear off over time .
26,36 ADR

Very drowsy and tired and no pain relief at all .

Unlike previously taking just one tablet of Aleve , which immediately took away my pain symptoms , this drug had absolutely no effect at all .


My doctor prescribed this drug ( instead of Aleve ) , to be taken twice daily , but after reading the side effects , I am concerned about that frequency .


I ' ll not bother with it anymore and will occasionally take Aleve instead .


Fortunately my pharmacy made an error in only giving me 6 tablets instead of 60 .


I ' m glad it happened ; it saved me an unnecessary expense .

I had no side effects until I started drinking Grapefruit juice .


Then I felt like crap and stopped taking the Lipitor .


Now I ' m off the grapefruit juice and back on the Lipitor and I feel great again .


Do NOT drink Grapefruit juice while taking Lipitor !


Check the label .


Grapefruit juice blocks the action of an enzyme that clears your bllodstream of the drug .


Without the enzyme , blood levels of Lipitor can get very high and cause toxic reactions .

A week later I had several ( 22 ) episodes of the body flushes ( within a 5 hour period ) which sent me back to the hospital .

But in general the whole formula is poison so far as I am concerned .


Thank God for this website .

9,11 ADR

i wonder if there is a genetic component related to this - - if some people with genetic variability suffered an interaction with statin ( as the environmental agent ) to produce this neurodegenerative disease .


however rarely this occurs , given taht there are millions of people taking this class of drugs , if it is due to genetic variability , there could be enormous numbers of people suffering from neuro symptoms .


i have heard from people who think their amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is due to statins , and from people who think their parkinson / s is due to statins .


others have questioned the diagnosis of alzheimer ' s and the use of aa statin .


given taht these 3 neurodegenerative diseases are thought to be due to the same underlying molecular pathology , it is not a far fetched question - - do statins indue neurodegenerative diseases in susceptible individuals ? ? ? ? ? .

I am unable to move them in any direction but the normal motion .


It has got to the point where turning over in bed wakes me up because of the pain it causes .
17,17 ADR

I have had a blood test to determine if Lipior is causing this serious problem and the results said no it wasn ' t .


However , I even went to an orthopdetic surgeon and after he checked me out , he looked at the drugs that I take ( i am also a type 2 diabetic ) and he said ahh , Lipitor .


more people taking this drug come to me with problems like this .

I had a LAD artery 100 % blocked a couple years ago and suffered a miocardial infarction .


The pain was unbearable and the pain from the headache Lipitor caused was WORSE !
6,9 ADR

I ' ve taken Zocor , Crestor and had similar problems with side effects , but i thought Lipitor was going to cause my death .


NEVER again ! .


None as of yet .


Droped Total Chol to 181 .


Triglycerides jumped to 461 !


Doc says it is not related to the Lipitor ( I find it hard to believe ) .


Will see what Tricor and Lipitor do together .


Most of the side effects everyone else has : weak legs , muscle and back soreness , ears ringing , feel bad , all usually in the mornings .
9,10 ADR|12,12,15,15 ADR|14,15 ADR|17,18 ADR|20,21 ADR

However , it lowered my cholesterol , tryglycerides , and blood pressure , along with a lot of exercising .


I had by - pass surgery in 1986 , angioplasty in the mid 90 ' s , started on Zocor , then my doctor switched me to Lipitor and have not had to have either since I started on the statins .


( started with 20 mg . then 40 mg . , and now 80 mg . )


Its not perfect , but it keeps me alive .


I am now 65 and I thank God every single day for my doctor and my medicine .

Also , bouts of nausia .
4,4 ADR

I went off the lipitor and within 3 days the pains were going away , 10 days and all was well .
10,10 ADR

It is a great med as long as you don ' t have the side effects .


My MD says that it is soluble in fat and builds up in the muscle .


He switched me to Crestor , similar med , but water soluble so it doesn ' t build up in your body as much .


So far so good .


My EKG was not good and a blood test also indicated a problem .


I was sent for a stress test which I failed , and was sent to a heart doctor .


I had no other symptoms of heart problems , but I had high blood pressure and overweight .


So lipitor was prescribed to lessen likelihood of partial blockage to my heart .


Cholesterol levels are terrific now and I may be sent for another stress test next month .


I feel great on Lipitor but could not take Zocor ( side effects ) .


Joint pain , muscle ache , fatigue .
0,1 ADR|3,4 ADR|6,6 ADR

While doctors will test your liver function on this medication , and they may run a blood test to check for muscle wasting , many doctors deny that there is a connection between joint pain , muscle aching , fatigue etc and Lipitor .
33,34 ADR|36,37 ADR|39,39 ADR

I stopped taking the medication and the symptoms gradually dissipated .


About a year later , I was put on it again and once again the same symptoms returned .


I saw another doctor and this physician is the one that stated that Lipitor is more than likely the cause .


Another family member was on Lipitor and experienced very similar symptoms .


She took herself off of the medication her symptoms also began to fade .


She demanded to be put on another medication and was .


Not all people who take Lipitor will have adverse reactions , but if you do experience these symptoms , don ' t just accept your doctor ' s denial of a connection between the two .


You may want to get a second opinion .

I am generally a well balanced type of person .


My depression did come on rather suddenly , about the same time as when I started the Lipitor .


My advice to you would be to listen to your BODY , it may be trying to tell you something .


Try diet and excercise to lower cholesterol ( this is Pfizer ' s recommendation also , see their package insert ) But .


SORRY Pfizer .


this is one gravy train you ' re not getting everyone on .

How IRONIC that I should suffer from statins my self .

It did reduce cholestoral , but seems to reduce the quality of life too .


Was put on lipitor 3 months ago because of high cholesteral .


Took for a month and seemed to have problems with feet , etc but kept taking .
8,10 ADR

I had tests done after a month .


My doctor sent a letter and said to cut the dose in half for a month and have tests again .


After my second set of tests she called me and told me to go off completely .


She said she realized that my cholesteral would go back up , but CPK is of concern .


Was raised to mid 200 ' s .


After a month I went in and of course my cholesteral was back up and my CPK level was elevated to over 500 .


Now am having another blood test a week later .


Not sure what it will show but I feel horrible .

0,4 ADR|6,9 ADR

this was the last shot at using a statin to reduce cholesterol ldl .


I have tried all the statin drugs , you know the very expensive drug of choice for all the doc ' s out there .


For all of you who now have extremely low LDL and a bad case of joint pain to the extent that it is very arthritic or having bad muscle cramps that you never got prior to the drug , it is from the statins .
15,16,23,24 ADR|28,29 ADR

The drug is able to decrease LDL through a mechanism which also destroys and depletes your bodies ability to make CoQ 10 .


This is necessary for they health of muscles and joints ( that ' s why you are experiencing the joint pains and numbness ) .
19,20 ADR|22,22 ADR

Remember your heart is a muscle , guess what is happening to it with the depletion of the CoQ 10 ? ? ?


If you do some research on the internet , you will find that all these statins make no claims / nor have studies shown them to reduce heart attacks , but they cause muscle problems i . e . your heart , this is based on the fact that they put younger and younger people on these drugs and .
33,34 ADR

I would recommend that you do your own research versus just listening to the doctor who wants your LDL down to like below 130 , neurosurgeons , who have studied this would tell you not to get it all too low .


And just because your test come back and show your liver functions are fine and don ' t show any broken down muscle toxins in the blood doesn ' t mean the lack of CoQ 10 isn ' t breaking down and damaging your muscles very slowly .
42,44 ADR

Mine always showed fine and I had severe arthritis symptoms in knees and hip joints ( never had this in my life before statins ) and bad muscle cramps ( also never got those until statins ) .
7,10,13,14 ADR|7,11 ADR|27,28 ADR

Granted is you have high blood pressure , high LDL , over weight and maybe smoke , then you probably need something to lower the LDL , if you only have high LDL , you don ' t .


Read the drug company studies , they even say it may help prevent a heart attack when you have 3 of the aforementioned risk factors .


I have a slipped vertabrae and a degenerative disk .


This medicine has been extrememly helpful .

6,8 ADR

I still had the urge to urinate constantly but it would come and go and I would have no symptoms for a day then it would return again .
4,6 ADR

I remembered reading the phamplet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that I was experiencing .


I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any more stomach pain or urgency .
15,16 ADR|18,18 ADR

I also had been experiencing lack of energy for quite some time and I attributed this to stress but after reading this website I feel it was due to the Lipitor also .
5,7 ADR

I don ' t think I will take this drug anymore and since I read that taking vitamin C can help you with your cholesterol I think I will try this method instead .


I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects .


I don ' t want to be a case - study when they finally take this drug off the market .

The problem is if i stop arthrotec I become paralysed by back pain .

But not sure if my symptoms are due to the drug as i ' ve been on it for so long with no side effects .


After trying several NSAIDs with side effects , I finally discovered arthrotec which relieved the pain and no side effects .

Cholesterol didn ' t / couldn ' t cause me near that problems that Lipitor is responsible for causing .


the first pill i took it caused severe abdominal pain but after taking the first one it never did that again , but recently i ' ve been feeling like my stomach is full and empty at the same time hard to explain but thats what it felt like , and also have been getting bruises allover my body due to this drug , other than that my back is back to normal now and i am back at work .

He gave me about 25 samples of Arthrotec 75 .


3 days later I cannot believe how good my back feels .


It has to be this drub , because this is the first day i can comfortably bend down with no pain and even touch my toes without bending my knees .

Lipitor works fine for lowering cholesterol , but the side effects are killers , apparently .


I have been experiencing extreme leg weakness and pain , to the point where I cannot take steps without holding on or going up on my knees - - which is agony .
4,5,8,8 ADR|4,6 ADR

After reading the comments on this page , I am shocked that so many people have experienced the same symptoms ( weakness , etc ) after taking Lipitor .
21,21 ADR

I ' ve been on the drug 7 or 8 years , and have gone off before when leg pain began .
18,19 ADR

But this time the problems came on more gradually , yet more severely .


They include stiff neck , diarrhea , clumsiness and dizziness .
2,3 ADR|5,5 ADR|7,7 ADR|9,9 ADR

I ' m going off it tonight .


nausea , no sleep , bad dreams , muscle and joint pain , tiredness .

There must be something better than this .


I am going to try POLICOSANOL .


Pain in shoulders joints to the point it was impossible to reach for anything above my shoulders .
0,3 ADR

Quit taking it and was back to normal in two months .


My doctor said it was arthritis or bursitus due to my age .


He still would rather I be a cripple and go back on Lipitor .


10 MG a day of lipitor and 6 months later I have extreme leg pain in the calves after just walking a few blocks , in a brain fog with memory loss , Vision is giving me problems and feel like shit all the time .
12,17 ADR|27,28 ADR|30,31 ADR|33,37 ADR|39,44 ADR

This drug should have a pre - qualifier before perscribed or better yet .


take all the statin drugs off the market .


This drug is dangerous .


I ' m almost inspired to start my own web site to warn people of the risk in taking any statin drug for a quick fix .


Constant stomach discomfort and pain , distension , gas , muscle aches , leg cramps .
1,1,4,4 ADR|1,2 ADR|6,6 ADR|8,8 ADR|10,11 ADR|13,14 ADR

Experimentation with stopping the treatment for a few weeks brought relief .


On re - starting , the symptons rapidly returned .


I now intend to ask my doctor for an alternative .


inflamatory muscle pain and soreness in upper back , head pain and pressure and the feeling of being in a fog .
0,2 ADR|4,7 ADR|9,9,12,12 ADR|9,10 ADR|15,20 ADR

EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DRUG !


I have never had these problems until I started Lipitor .


I have discontinued it 2 weeks ago with now a 40 % reduction in side effects but the pain is still really bad .
18,18 ADR

Does anyone know how long it will take for the side effects to completely go away ?


Will they go away ?


Lipitor lowered my cholesterol from 268 to 163 but it nearly killed me in return .


It ' s not worth it .


The doctor told me I was imagining all this and said it was so safe it should be in the drinking water supply .


Can you believe that !


This drug is an extremely dangerous poison .


The Pfizer website is very low - key about the side effects .


You better take matters into your own hands as Pfizer ' s only concern is profits - NOT your health .


Muscle aches .
0,1 ADR

now have fibromyalgia .


Memory , learning problems , brain fog , depression , extreme fatigue .
0,0 ADR|2,3 ADR|5,6 ADR|8,8 ADR|11,11 ADR

In horrible pain , I quit taking it and replaced it with natural therapies .
2,2 ADR

Starting to feel better .


I hope and pray the damage isn ' t permanent .


This medication is nothing but a pharmaceutical money maker .


It should be banned ! !


I wish I would have known the side effects when I started taking it , instead of dealing with extreme pain for so many years ! .
19,20 ADR

weakness , fatigue , muscle spasms , stiffness all over , achilles tendonitis that won ' t heal , flu - like symptoms , feeling like an old lady .
0,0 ADR|2,2 ADR|4,5 ADR|7,7 ADR|12,12 ADR|19,22 ADR

I ' ve been on Lipitor for almost 2 years as a booster for a type of kidney malfunction .


Over that time I ' ve gradually become weaker , stiff , and low in energy and over the past few weeks I ' ve developed flu like syptoms and muscle spasms .
8,8 ADR|10,10 ADR|13,15 ADR|30,31 ADR|26,28 ADR

My achilles tendonits just won ' t get better despite 3 months of PT .
2,2 ADR

I saw my doctor about this today and he suggested going off the Lipitor to see if it was causing this .


Thank you all for posting such enlightening information .


I hope that we all do better off this drug ! .


Lipitor had the same side effects as Zocor and confirmed that Zocor caused myalgia , neuralgia , insomnia , dementia , polyneuropathy , rhabdomyolisis , subdural hematoma , coma , and pain , pain pain .


Lipitor seems to cause even more nerve damage than Zocor .


Before they go to Hell , the people at Pfizer and the doctors who shill for them should be sent to a very nasty prison .


Pfizer and its doctor salesmen should be stripped of every asset including their medical licenses .


They should be totally destroyed .


The proceeds of their financial liquidation should be distributed to their victims .


I am writing this for my husband - - memory loss , tremors in right hand , symptoms of parkinson ' s disease .
9,10 ADR|12,15 ADR|17,22 ADR

since lipitor causes a decrease in coenzyme q 10 and now there is a study in the archives of neurology showing that using large doses of coenzyme q 10 slows the progression of parkinson ' s disease , i wonder how many others have experienced a diagnosis of parkinson ' s having been on lipitor ?


we began questioning the role of lipitor in Parkinson ' s when my niece ' s husband who is 57 was experiencing the same symptoms as my husband ( the 57 yr old was diagnosed with Parkinson ' s 2 weeks ago ) and the major factor in common between the 2 of them - - Lipitor for 4 + yrs .


not worth the risks of taking the drug .


will now control cholesterol with diet and exercise .

0,2 ADR|4,5 ADR|7,8 ADR|10,13 ADR|15,15 ADR|17,21 ADR|24,24 ADR|27,28 ADR

Have mentioned symptoms as they appeared to my doctor only to be prescribed zorloft for depression and anxiety and noten for heart palpatations .
15,15 ADR|17,17 ADR|21,22 ADR

This in turn has seriously upset my stomach which the doctor prescribed yet another drug for .
4,7 ADR

40 mg dose Lipitor worked well in reducing my overall cholesterol levels ; which are high in my family .


The last 6 months of my life have been a health nightmare .


I was a fit , strong and very active person 5 years ago .


Now I am struggling walking too far and functioning in general .
3,6 ADR

I have only been off lipitor for 2 weeks so time will tell if lipitor is to blame for my deteriorated health ; winding down on the noten and zorloft as well .


I am trying the VitC , CoQ 10 and omega 3 path .


SEVERE AND UNCHARACTERISTIC DEPRESSION , ANXIETY , AGGRESSION , AND MOOD SWINGS .
3,3 ADR|5,5 ADR|7,7 ADR|10,11 ADR

I cannot stress this enough - my personality comepletely changed after beginning this medication .


I am typically an easy going , positively thinking , emotionally stable , and motivated person .


But after starting Lipitor I ' ve gradually descended into a world of extreme anxiety , hopelessness , lonliness , and self loathing .
14,14 ADR|16,16 ADR|18,18 ADR|21,22 ADR

I ' ve never in my life been so depressed , so obsessively focused on morbid , terrifying thoughts , or so negative about everything in my life .
9,9 ADR|12,15 ADR|17,18 ADR|22,27 ADR

After being off of this medication for only 48 hours , I am already beginning to see an improvement in my moods , but this will be a long journey back to my old self , I feel .


Oh yes , and I also suffered from : Gas , Constipation , EXTREME FATIGUE , weight gain and bloating , and occassional bouts of diaharrea .
9,9 ADR|11,11 ADR|14,14 ADR|16,17 ADR|19,19 ADR|25,25 ADR

It lowered my cholesterol , to be sure .


But it also significantly lowered my quality of life .


This website has been an absolute lifeline for me .


My doctor had seemed so completely unwilling to accept that my symptoms could ' ve possibly been related to my taking Lipitor .


However , I know my body and know when things are not as they should be .


I have been feeling this way since almost immediately after I took my first dose .


Hearing that so many other people have experienced the same exact symptoms as me has given me the courage needed to STOP this medication .


So many of my family members and friends have had bad reactions to this stuff - I can not trust it , and will be looking for another way to get my cholesterol under control , if possible .


Be very careful and very informed before you start any new medication .


Don ' t always trust the word of your doctor as the only word and take it at its face value .


When it comes to your body , you have every right to dictate , understand , and call the shots about what does and does not go in to it .


For the past year and half I have been taking Lipitor .


I have been experiencing extreme pain in my should and arm .
4,10 ADR

It is the same arm which has no lymph nodes and a modified radical mascetomy .


I have had 3 steriod shots to some relief - - but - - short lived .


Finally , dawned on me - - I missed taking Lipitor over the weekend and on Monday the pain was gone .
18,18 ADR

Started taking it again on Monday .


Pain returned .
0,0 ADR

Is there a correlation .


I ' m stopping the Lipitor .


I was due a MRI next week and possibly surgery on right shoulder with the pain .
15,15 ADR

Cramping and weariness of the leg muscles .
0,0,3,6 ADR|2,6 ADR

Always tired .
0,1 ADR

After about a year I didn ' t see any lower chlorestoral .


Absolutely none ! .


I was originally taking 150 mg per day , but cut it to 100 mg because the lesser dose seemed to work as well .


My internist had urged me to take Vioxx , Celebrx and Bextra ( at different times , of course ) , but the relief I experienced was not as dramatic as the Cataflam .


My orthopaedic surgeon prescribes the Cataflam .


It has a slight effect on my blood pressure , but , since my pressure is usually low , that is not considered a health risk .
3,8 ADR

None that I am aware of .


Used other cholesterol medication and lifestyle changes , but cholesterol did not reach normal levels until I was put on Lipitor .


The only side effect that I experienced was the hungry feeling in my stomach ; however I have no complaints , just praise !

This drug makes me so agitated - - insomnia , hideously increased muscle tension , short tempered , impatient .
5,5 ADR|10,13 ADR|15,16 ADR|8,8 ADR|18,18 ADR

It really helped with pain in hand & arm , but the agitation is unbearable .
12,12 ADR

I got spasms in my back from it and had to get therapy for those .
2,5 ADR

I know it doesn ' t make sense with the tiny dose I ' m taking , & they say no systemic effects from the topical gel , but I ' ve gone on & off it 4 or 5 times now and the effects when using it are unmistakeable .


I ' m not sure if this is related to the lipitor , but shortly after I started taking it , I exprienced complete paralysis in my forehead ( peripheral neuropathy ) .
24,24 ADR|29,30 ADR

Went to a neurologist , GP and ENT , none of whom have ever seen this kind of paralysis ( both sides ) with no other symptoms .
18,18 ADR

Has any one else come across this symptom ?


I m tempted to go off the medicine to see if the paralysis goes away .
12,12 ADR

It really lowered my cholestrol a lot , so I hope this problem isn ; t related .
