It has brought me to tears and I have had to use sick leave from work .


My doctor tested me for arthritis and other problems and all tests came back normal but thank goodness she took me off the Lipitor .


I would not recommend this medication .


Particularly diahrea !
1,1 ADR

Many unscheduled washroom stops over the time I ' ve taken this medication .


Lately ankle swelling and lower tendon pain that was not experienced previously .
1,2 ADR|4,6 ADR

Males tend to tolerate this medication better than women from my observation .


This medication helped get me back to work and achieve tolerable pain levels and mobility .


I stopped taking it for 4 days and the pain returned .


Currently take one 75 mg dose 2 hours before work and seems to be enough to ease my particular condition .


Probably alright for otherwise healthy individuals but those with other medical problems should probably avoid it .


It will most likely exacerbate there ill health with unwelcome side effects .


Knee and hip joint pain .

Had experienced knee joint pain in past , but never hip .

Remaining issue is chest spasm - - have been through tests ruling out heart , GERD , pneumonia , etc Spasms persist although less and less .

Last 48 hours , epsiodes seemed to increase again but may be attributable to some combination of muscle weakness and heavy non - stop rains we ' ve enjoyed for several days .

Cholesterol news is great - - two days after I stopped , cholesterol was measured at 172 with excellent HDL , LDL and triglyceride levels - - down from 295 in May , consistent with the last ten years of cholesterol readings for me .


Tests also showed no calcium build - up on my arteries one week ago .


Was on a dose of 40 mg .


Will see how muscle symptoms are in a month and try to resume at 10 mg .


Does anyone know how long they think it should take symptoms to go away ? .

Additionally , I was experiencing severe cramping in my legs and back .
5,8,11,11 ADR|5,9 ADR

The good news was that my cholesterol dropped from 269 to 160 .


The bad news was that long term , it would likely impact the heart muscle .


Once the doctor saw the CPK levels on my next liver function test , he called ( himself ) and said to stop taking Lipitor immediately .


Interestingly , Niaspan had the same effect .


I ' m currently trying a therapy of 6000 mg . of vitamin C daily .

I have some acid reflux thats developed over the last few years , which may not be related since it runs in the family .


Works great !


Hard to function without ( pain ) , when I ran out .


Im probably addicted to it .


Somewhat concerned about the long term effects and listed possible side effects , so I ' ve only ever taken arthrotec 50 once daily rather than twice , which is just enough to manage my pain levels .


I feel it has a cummulative effect .


maybe .


I dont think anything will completely remove the pain , and maybe shouldnt since it helps you to know whats going on .


Else how much would you have to take , thus increasing your risk for possible adverse reactions .

Bad choice on my part .


I hope now that the 9 months of taking these meds hasn ' t caused permanent damage ! ! .


After reading more about the medication I can only say that for me .


I am done with taking statins .


I will control my cholesterol by losing weight , exercise and diet .

I ' m completeing this on behalf of my father , who died after being prescribed 20 mg Totalip / Atorvastatin , despite the usual dose being 10 mg and him having 2 risk factors , being over 70 and with hypothyroidism .


The inquest verdict was misadventure .


The GMC decided that the 20 mg dose was reasonable , and that the GP had not acted inappropriately by prescribing this dose .


So much for SPCs , PILs , and the CSM ' s Pharmacovigilance reports , all of which state that the usual dose is 10 mg a day , and that statins should be used with caution by patients over 70 and with hypothyroidism .


GPs will continue overprescribing if they are allowed to get away with it .


Please contact me if you can advise or help .


Thanks .

59 year old female with diabetes , heart disease , high blood pressure and high cholestrol / triglycerides .


Neurologist , cardiologist , and internist stated my symptoms were not all related to Lipitor side effects .


After trying Zocor , Provachol , Zetia and Crestor , Lipitor seemed to be the lessor of the evils with regard to side effects .


However , due to heart problems , cardiologist gradually increased the Lipitor dosage from 10 mg to 40 mg .


Symptoms have been gradual over the years with recent face and scalp problems diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia after MRI ruled out tumor or MS .

After reading your comments regarding Liptior , I have decided to reduce the dosage from 40 mg to 20 mg for a week to see if this relieves the most recent symptoms .


If improvement is noted , then I will contact my doctor for a further reduction in the dosage to determine if other symptoms abate .


I appreciate all the feedback on this medication and will keep you posted on my progress .

23,24,27,27 ADR|23,24,29,29 ADR|36,38 ADR

She shakes as if she has Parkinsons .


If I had not seen the news recently about the two men suing Pfizer over what Lipitor had done to their lives , I wouldn ' t have even thought about that being the cause .


Finding this website confirmed it .


I have taken her off the Lipitor , and am hoping that alot of her pain and fatigue and muscle problems will start to get better , although it scares me that alot of people are saying they haven ' t improved .
15,15 ADR|17,17 ADR|19,20 ADR

I am fed up with all those medications which ALL induce side effects , for which your doctor will prescribe more and more medications .


That is when hell starts .


My hair was falling off , I could not lose weight even exercising and eating healthy food .
1,4 ADR|7,16 ADR

When I stopped Lipitor , my hair stopped falling immediately and I lost 4 lbs the 1 st week , without doing anything different .


You completely destroy your metabolism absorbing chemicals .


Now I stopped all that and I am going the NATURAL way with good results .


I recommend acupuncture , homeopathy , natural supplements ( I highly recommend Apple Cider Vinegar and raw honey , those made my blood pressure go down by 30 points ! ) , good nutrition and exercise are much better and you will not enrich those pharmaceutical companies which are after your money , just trying to erase the symptoms but NOT the cause .


Take charge !


It is time .


Absolutely none .


No muscle or joint problems through 1 year .
1,1,4,4 ADR|3,4 ADR

Lowered CHol from 251 to 171 with only 10 mg .


I was prescribed Voltaren - XR 100 MG for lower back pain .


It worked wonders for my pain - I thought that I had discovered a wonder drug - then after 30 days I was at work and started passing massive amounts of blood without pain or warning .
27,31 ADR

I thought I was bleeding to death !
4,4 ADR

I went to the ER and was admitted and had a colonoscopy the next day .


The Dr discover an ulcer in by lower bowel which he believes was caused by the Voltaren .
4,4,7,8 ADR

The bleeding has now stopped and I am OK , but I will never take this drug or any drug in it ' s class again .


Hindsight is 20 - 20 .


I did not experience any of the myriad of possible side effects of the drug .


Started experiencing pain in my right heel when walking in mid - November ; it got worse over time so I went to see my orthopedist in early December and he said I had plantar fasciitis ; he showed me stretching exercises and advised me to get inserts for my walking shoes , wear cushioned house slippers and avoid walking up inclines .


The pain lessened by following all these recommendations but I was still uncomfortable a lot of the time .


I finally went to see the orthopedist in March and he said my foot " can " improve if I continued with the exercises , etc At the very end , he asked if he had given me the " patch " at my first appointment ; so I left with a sample and a prescription for the Flector patch .


I cut a patch ( there are five in each reclosable pouch ) in half and it covers the heel area .


After I used it the first time , the puffiness and pain were gone !


I found it best to use the patch at night only although you can replace it every 12 hours .


I put the patch on at bedtime , tape the edges down and wear a sock to secure it .


Initially , I used it every night and after about three weeks , was able to cut down to several times a week .


It certainly helped to make the past month more comfortable .

I now use tylenol extra for arthritis .


Voltaren should in my opinion be given rectally to the mfg .


It did alleviate the arthritis pain .


It also made me dependent on tagamet after a few years .

I was on voltaren for over 3 years .

Doctor suspected Neuropathy when Athlete ' s foot couldn ' t be detected .


Neurologist said stop taking Lipitor immediately .


The damage was done as it spread to my hands and up my legs .


Have been off Lipitor eight months and still have problems .


From what I read I fear this will be with me .


This is dangerous as doctors are handing this out like candy and are not monitoring their patients closely .


The dark side of Statins far overshadow the benefits .


Very very severe abdonimal pain , next day my stool was black which could indicate blood in my stool , going to doctor today .

I ran this test several times .


It has taken its toll on my stomach in the past but it is the most effective med so far .

Must take it with a full meal .


I really made a difference , improvement of quality of life .


Had a scary experience that I am associating with Voltaren .


Not completely convinced it was the RX but I have no other reason for the reaction .


First dosage I was hit with extreme abdominal issues including diarrhea .
10,10 ADR|6,8 ADR

Figured it was a lack of adequate food on board when I took the 1 st dose so increased my meal before I took the 2 nd dose .


Problem solved !


Was on the meds for 7 days when I experienced chest discomfort and upper abdominal pressure .
10,11 ADR|14,15 ADR

With a medical background , I know that cardiac symptoms are mistaken for gastric reasons so I went to the ER .


Long story short , I was diagnosed with severe gastric distress ( GERD ) and with a " gastric cocktail " and a high octane prilosec , I had some serious relief and sent home .


Not convinced it was the issue , I went a day without the RX and then started again .


I wasn ' t entirely 100 % after taking the dose and now , I am fairly certain it was the Voltaren .


I must say that my symptoms did improve within 3 days but the ER visit was .


DEPRESSION , INSOMNIA , anxiety , tiredness , decreased eye sight , loss of quality of life .
0,0 ADR|2,2 ADR|4,4 ADR|6,6 ADR|8,10 ADR

Effective drug for lowering cholesterol , but not worth the reduction in quality of life .


Please be carefull with lipitor and the other statins ! !


PS : I ' ve stopped taking Lipitor after consulting my physician .


He fully agreed .


It dropped my cholestrol down fast .


My liver tests are good .


I take 20 mg a night .


Cholestrol runs about 200 .


lethargy and leg soreness .
0,0 ADR|2,3 ADR

Anxiety , paranoia .
0,0 ADR|2,2 ADR

I went to see my doctor and told him about my discovery .


First he was a bit reluctant but in the following meeting he already told me that he had read about Lipitor ' s psychiatric side effects .


He therefore put me off Lipitor completely and suggested a much lower dosage of 10 mg Crestor .


In addition , he prescribed a new medication : Niacin , beginning with 500 mg the first month and then increasing to 1 , 000 in the second ( with the ultimate aim of reaching 2 , 000 in the fourth monthly ) .


Bottom line : When I discontinued Lipitor two months ago my LDL reached 165 .


This week my blood test indicated an LDL level of 124 .


So , after being helped by folks on this website I hope I can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects .


Therefore , here is what I ' ve done during the past two months : - Took 500 mg of Niacin during the first months and 1 , 000 mg during the second ; - Took a total of 10 Crestor pills ( 10 mg which are equivalent to 20 mg of Lipitor ) per month , i . e . , one every three days .


- Two natural pills of Phytosterol .


- A cup of tea made of olive leafs .


Now , I do believe that when I reach the maximum intake of Niacin in two months ( 2 , 000 mg ) the LDL will drop from 124 to 100 ( the level required for diabetics ) .


Good luck , folks ! .


Fatigue , very tired after working hours ( and I ' m not doing much phisical work ) .

Over the years , I had previously been prescribed steroid nasal sprays , allegra ( even though tests showed no allergies ) , nexium , cough medicine , sinus irrigation , & various sleeping pills to deal with what I now know was my reaction to statins .


Nothing helped alleviate these symptoms .


Besides the toll that statins have taken on my quality of life , I ' ve also spent tens of thousands of dollars on doctors , drugs , tests , labs , & procedures .


I even purchased a sleep number bed & a new sofa , thinking that would help my insomnia & back pain .

I remembered reading the phamplet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that I was experiencing .


I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any mor .


I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects .

The cramps and tightness was sporatic from ankles , to calf to top of thigh then back of thigh , it didn ' t make sense as I hadn ' t done anything out of the ordinary to be feeling this way and it felt different than a overworked muscle type of pain .
1,1 ADR|3,3 ADR

Although the Lipitor brought my level from 206 down to 143 within 6 weeks from what I have been reading I don ' t think I will begin taking it again .


I stopped about a week ago , although my Dr didn ' t think that was the cause , however , nothing else made sense .

I was given a 6 day trial of Arthrotec along with a 9 day trial of Aciphex on 4 / 25 ( three bottles of three pills ) .


This was a solution my doctor came up with .


I ' ve never had consistant heart burn or indigestion , no signs of acid reflux , so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication .


The first day I took both pills , I experienced some dizziness and some nausea and some serious period like cramps .

I was at work , so I just had to brush it off .


It continued each time I took it .


After about two days ( two doses ) , the cramps continued and began inhibiting my menstrual cycle ( which I was due to start ) .

While taking 10 mg I have experienced no adverse side effects .


It was only when increased to 20 mg / day that I experienced increased bone and muscle pain .
14,14,17,17 ADR|16,17 ADR

I have been taking Lipitor 10 mg per day since 1997 with no adverse effects .


The only problem I experienced was when one Dr increased my dose to 20 mg per day to lower LDL to prevent another infarction .


I have never had real high cholesterol , 218 at tops and now am around 158 total , triglycerides are also excellent .


I have found that when using substitutes for this drug , I experience adverse effects , so I only take the name brand now .


Good drug if you are started with a low dose right off the bat .


Many Docs want to start you at 20 mg or above , too much for the body to take , I think .

My brother is also on Lipitor and has had recent knee surgery for a torn miniscus and ACL .


He is also on testosterone therapy .


Im only 47 and he is 45 .


This sounds like alot of physical problems for guys our age .


It wasnt until he mentioned that he had heard about the possible dangers that statins have on tendons that I saw all of these other people and their problems with Lipitor .


This could be the reason for many things that I have been suffering physically .


I am getting off the Lipitor immediately for a few months to see if some of my symptoms get better .


Fish oil , niacin , vitimin c , and a healthy diet ! ! ! .


I was on Pravachol for about 10 years without any significant reduction in my total cholesterol .


Was switched to Lipitor 40 mg initially with fair results and then to 80 mg with excellent results .


My present total cholesterol is 160 , HDL , LDL and ratios are all acceptable .


Have noticed no side effects .


My only complaint with the drug is the cost and the fact that Pzier has not allowed the generic to be manufactured in the USA until 2012 and yet it is available this year in the UK as a generic .


Started on 10 mg , dose doubled to 20 mg then to 40 mg .


Experienced severe muscle pains , cramps , sore leg joints which increased with raising of dose , walking more than a few hundred yards became difficult .

I did not associate symptoms with tablets until I researched the Web .


I have stopped taking the tablets for nearly a month now and and I am much improved , though my knees still ache .


HDL / LDL balance much improved , but I would not want to start taking Lipitor again as I feel it disrupted my life considerably .


Even though statistically ( anecdotally ) I am part of a small minority suffering side effects , I would still urge caution when taking this medication .

I loved my job and have only 1 regret , that I ever educated people on the dangers of High Cholesterol , and convinced them to take these poisons .


Cholesterol has very little to do with heart disease , and ALL statins are toxic .

No noticeable side effects .


Lowered cholesterol and triglycerides .


I have been taken for approximately 4 yrs .


I have some difficulty with digestive system and some muscle pain and joint pain .
3,6 ADR|9,10 ADR|12,13 ADR

Lipitor did the job on my cholesterol both LDL and HDL .


I have quit taken recently to see if it affects above problems .


It probably is a trade off .


I feel that the drug is too expensive .


I do think that it will do what it is used for , but I think your body pays a price .


Again I think it is a trade off .


Where to begin ?

Subsequently , I quit the drug and the MD .


All symptoms subsided completely .


However , I had a milder reaction to Zocor ; dizziness with Pravachol ; now on Zetia ( mild joint pain ) .


I believe that Lipitor left me with permanent joint damage and would join any class - action lawsuit relating to this crumby drug Lipitor .

I have been to neurologists and had emg , bone Dr . for xrays primary Dr And now the major hospital to the big guys .


I will have a more intense emg and then they will do biopsies on my limbs and thigh .


not one Dr will blame Lipitor .


I guess it ' s the forbidden word to say if it ' s something negetive .


This stuff is definitely for everybody .


By the way I was only on it approx 4 months .


Sad to read so many people are suffering from side effects of this but good to know I am not nuts and I am not alone .


A huge money maker so I doubt it will ever be taken off the market .


I ' ve read short term and long term users of this stuff .


I am beginnig to wonder if it ' s just a matter of time for everyone who ' s on it .

Taking all at same time now , pain is too great !

not enough .


corrections - it was advicor not navicor .


I started to take 20 mg lipitor in August 2006 , after 6 months , I reduced to take 10 mg , and after another 6 months , I reduced the lipitor intake to 5 mg .


During all these 18 months , my LDL and cholesterol in 70 s and 120 s and I did not feel much side effects .


When I incresed lipitor from 5 mg to 10 mg about 3 months ago , I started to experience the following side - effects started at different time : loss body balance , joint pain , muscle aches , weak legs , and some memory loss .
29,31 ADR|33,34 ADR|36,37 ADR|39,40 ADR|44,45 ADR

About 2 months ago while I first told my doctor I lost some body balance and it might be due to lipitor buy my doctor told me the side effect was most likely by some other reason ( s ) .
11,14 ADR

During my second visiting him , he told me my blood test CK is 90 and my muscle should be OK .


Then I continued to take 10 mg lipitor , but I felt more on muscle and joint pain and I started to feel I lost some memory .
14,14,17,17 ADR|16,17 ADR|24,26 ADR

Therefore , I deeply believed that I had side effects by taking lipitor .


After about a week to 10 day without lipitor , I got my memory back to nomal level and my body balance is getting better .


During my third doctor visit , my doctor finally believed that I got bad side effects and he told me it would take months for recovery .


Now my doctor wants me to take B 3 or Niaspan instead of lipitor .


After taking Lipitor for several months , and gradually incrasing my dose to 40 mg , I started to get EXTREMELY fatigued .
20,21 ADR

I had to take a nap every day for 2 - 3 hours .


After discontinuing the medicine , my energy levels bounced back to normal .


It really helped lower my cholesterol , but have to wonder what it was doing to me to make me so tired .

Doctors unable to connect the dots ( Lipitor = above symptoms ) .


Sure it lowered my cholesterol .


But at what cost ?


I told my doctor I was feeling weak .
6,7 ADR

He commented I see NO reason for you to be weak ( Even though he prescribed the Lipitor for me )
10,10 ADR

Well needless to say that was the last time I saw him .


I thought I had MS , Lupus , Fibromyalgia or some other illness that has the symptoms I was experiencing .


I found that Lipitor could be the reason for all of these symptoms .


So , on my own , I stopped the Lipitor ( I was only on 10 mg per day )


Within 48 hours I felt my mood elevating back to normal .


So far ( I ' ve been off of it for about 5 days now ) , my chest pain has improved by about 75 % .

This is no coincidence I am certain .


Hopefully my other symptoms of fatigue , anxiety , memory and insomnia will alleviate as well .

Metabolic syndrome is genetic , since my 8 and 4 year children tested with High LDL .


Simply don ' t know what to do to bring LDL down .


At this stage it is not clear what is better of the two evils : Lipitor or High LDL ?


And how to lower LDL without the side effects of statins ?


Vegetarian diet ( approx . 5 % saturated fat ) and Exercise is already close to perfection based on the available information , but still left elevated LDL / HDL ratio to 5 + if not on Lipitor .


None for three years , then bam !


Toes became so painful I couldn ' t stand it , as did leg neuropathy .

Medical personnel dismissed the symptoms as not being related to taking this drug , but once I stopped taking , my cramping and bleeding stopped .

Subsequent uterine & vaginal ultrasounds did not show anything else to be the cause .


My OB / Gyn told me that she uses misoprostal ( 1 of the drugs in Arthrotec ) for miscarriages & advised me to stop taking the drug .


I would not recommend to females .


If you do take this drug , please pay careful attention to your body and other symptoms that may appear .


Read all drug material carefully .


This drug enables me to be much more physically active with less dependence on pain relievers .


I can bike at fairly high levels of intensity for as much as 25 miles .


I haven ' t tried longer but I ' m sure I could and getting to that level was a great accomplishment .


I have had 6 knee surgeries including 2 partial replacements .


Use it before exercise .


Reapply after shower and before bed .

LEt me be the first to say that I have extremely porous skin , so I am probably absorbing a higher dose than was thought likely , I have eczema and take other meds that exfoliate my skin , so probably a whopping dose is going in .

Lipitor !


I have since changed doctors because my doctor told me he did not believe it was the lipitor since it should have affected me on both arms and hands , but as soon as I stopped the lipitor I stated to feel better , it has been three weeks now I still have some pain in muscles , but severe fatigue is gone , Problem now is my new doctor is suggesting Pravachol !

In November of 2005 I was prescribed Lipitor for elevated cholesterol .

Within two months , I had developed wicked back pain , along with neuropathy and hypersensitivity that wrapped around my abdomen .
7,9 ADR|13,13 ADR|15,20 ADR

We suspected the Lipitor was involved , so I went off it , since my numbers had gotten really low .


I was effectively laid up for about six months .


Since there was no immediate improvement , we surmised that Lipitor wasn ' t causing this .


It ' s October 2006 now , and I ' m starting to feel more like myself , still hurts but I can work around it .


The cholesterol has crept up , so two weeks ago we started the Lipitor again , and within a few days I was paractically flat on my back again !


So , I ' ve stopped again .


It ' s a bloody shame this is happening , as the drug was extremely effective in dropping that cholesterol .


Too bad , we ' re going to have to try something else , I guess .

Overall this seems to be working reasonably well - - brought my triglycerides and LDL down to normal levels but not sure if it ' s really from the Lipitor or from major life - style changes and bringing my blood sugar down .


In any event , I haven ' t had any serious problems with this drug aside from having to be a bit more careful in the gym and being the butt of fart jokes .


Persistent triedness , loss of concentration , uncharacteristical moodiness , short term memory loss , light headedness ( in a daze type of thing ) unwarranted depression and the occasional thoughts of suicide , tightness and annoying stimuly type of feeling in the neck near the base of the skull , husky vocal chords .

2,6,13,18 ADR

Someone at the Dr ' s office recently recommended to me to do a search for possible connection between statin use and tendon damage / ruptures .


Much to my surprise there is a significant amount of study and history of this connection .


( Google statins tendon )


I have stopped the use of Lipitor immediately after finding out about this connection .


I have always been very active , athletic and have worked out pretty consistently since my High School years .


I am 41 now and cannot understand why now I am having th .

Stopped it a week ago and will NOT go back on it .


Didn ' t have much pain relief , and within a few days of starting the meds I began having cramps and heavy vaginal bleeding .

Common sense here folks please ; accept that everyone ' s different and drugs will affect us differently ; put any chemical down your throat and you ' ve got to accept that there could be consequences , sometimes not so good , sometimes awful - and sometimes blinkin ' marvellous .


Don ' t preach to others that this ( or any other ) is an evil drug ; go slowly and carefully and get a second opinion if desired .


Here are my experiences of taking Lipitor and Zocor statins over ~ NEARLY 30 YEARS ~ !


This length of time on statins has probably never even been logged before over such a long time .


Thankfully statins have done me a POWER OF GOOD so far .


High cholesterol is in my genes ; it killed my dad died at age 58 when I was just 14 .


I ' m now 57 ( male ) and hope to go on a bit longer : o ) Note : I live in the UK and Europe has a different cholesterol measurement system of mmol / litre versus the USA system of mg / decilitre .


Conversion rate : mmol / L x 38 . 5 = mg / dL .

For the first 8 days of ever taking it , the only side effect was a similar feeling you get when you have an empty stomach and light nausea that lasted for no more that 30 minutes
27,28 ADR

After 8 days , the feeling elevated to an annoying sharp pain in my stomach .
10,14 ADR

Then two days later , I had to stop using it because the pain was becoming unbearable .

The side effects were harder to deal with than the condition I was taking it for - and it made me feel 200 % worse !


Not worth it !


I will carefully take ibuprofen or Aleve ( naproxen sodium ) - limit using it as much as I am able - and deal with ulcers if I ever end up with one !


Taking this horrid stuff to prevent one just is not worth it !


Pharmacist finds it hard to believe one pill did all this - but looked at other meds , and no other explaination .

Do NOT fall for the Statin Drug Scam , as Big Pharma runs our little Family Dr Offices with Lunches & boxes full of Sample drugs , to either give to patien .


Never take this Drug or any other Statin Drug , as it has never been proven that Cholesterol will Kill you , especially when I know people who are not over weight and eat right only to have there Hi # above 400 and it is Genetic , with no one dying from Heart attacks in there Family ' s .

Lipitor does help reduce total serum cholesterol considerably in many patients but the side effects of this ' poisonous ' medication are extremely alarming .


I fail to comprehend why this medication is still permitted to be on the market as there is evidence that those who have been on long term have suffered irreversible muscle damage plus other permanent side effects .


How come no one has sued the manufacturers as yet ?


Do patients have to die first before a pharmaceutical entity can be sued ?


Surely some of the people who have written in to this site should get together and institute litigation ? .

( Cont ' d - Pt . 2 ) According to my ' GP ' ( Dr ) , the UK male ' desireable target ' is 5 . 1 mmol / litre or 196 mg / decilitre .


Docs now actually like you to be lower than that if possible .


In 1977 ( at age 28 ) with a ' count ' of 10 mmol / L ( 385 mg / dL ) , a VERY careful low - chol .


diet made virtually NO difference to my count .


So I went onto Zocor ( new - ish then ) and remained on it for 21 years , finally on a dose of 40 mg / day with no real side effects - it lowered my count to 5 . 6 mmol / L .


As my count started to rise again to 7 . 8 in 1997 ( at age 48 ) , I switched to Lipitor , starting with 20 mg / day and then 40 mg / day which dropped my count A LOT to just 5 . 1 mmol / L and with an HDL ' good cholesterol ' count of 1 . 6 .


After a 3 - week holiday without pills , my count rose to 10 . 4 , so I went back onto 40 mg / day of Lipitor - but my count was still only 6 . 7 , so I put myself onto 80 mg / day Lipitor and my count went down to 5 . 5 - this is the highest dose recommended .

I have an appt . scheduled to start to deal with this pain but an experience last night and reading some postings on this site are leading me to suspect the lipitor .

My usual 20 mg dose is taken with dinner , but I had forgotten to take it and remembered just before bedtime .


I awoke at 3 AM with an a knee that was just throbbing with pain .
8,8,12,14 ADR

I hobbled to the bathroom and took a dose of Advil and was able to get back to sleep after about a half hour .


I awoke this morning with about a 50 % reduction in pain and it seems to have subsided as the day goes on .
11,11 ADR

I will never take lipitor before bed again , I may cut the daily dose in half and possibly stop altogether if the pain persists at an intolerable level .
23,23 ADR

Lipitor has lowered my cholesterol levels to the 180 ' s .


I had never had a reading below 218 in my life and it has been steadily rising over the last few years to a consistent level in the 240 ' s .


The ratio of bad to good cholesterol is in the acceptable zone and never had been before taking lipitor .


So , all in all , the lipitor has done a good job .


I will try to cope with the joint pain , but if it becomes a constant problem , I will have to stop taking the drug .

I had to go to the emergency room of local hospital and that ' s where I learned of the side effects .


From the info on the web about this medication , it should not be given to anyone .


I can ' t believe it was approved at all .


I took it for about 8 years , starting at age 25 , with no side effects ( at least , nothing I attributed to the Lipitor ) .


Went off on a couple occasions to have a baby then right back on .


After 8 years , suddenly started having severe weaknesses in my legs , specifically thigh muscles felt like I had been trying to run marathons with no exertion .

Went off Lipitor and pain went away .

Now I ' m on Crestor and just started having even worse side effects : o ( .


This medication DID help lower my cholesterol , I was close to 300 when I started it ( and I did eat healthy and exercise moderately at the time , it ' s hereditary for me ) .


and I was taking 40 mg .


to get my cholesterol down around 200 .


My mother has taken it for even longer at max dose ( 80 mg ) and has had no side effects she attributes to the medication .


The bottom line is , listen and pay attention to your body .


everyone ' s body is different and some people can ' t take the same thing !

I started using the drug in Sept . 2005 .


In October / November I noticed my hands were nowhere near as strong as they once were - thought it was old age .

I also had a strange senistivity in the palms and soles of my feet , also in my scalp - it was uncomfortable blowing my hair dry .

It began with stomach pain , then slight nausea , then reflux each time I took a pill .

After the second pill the same progression of symptoms only now the abdominal gas , cramps and pain would be with me all day .
12,12,15,17 ADR|12,13 ADR

I stopped pills but abdominal cramps persist .
4,5 ADR

The only good thing I can say about Arthrotec is that I did notice pain relief but I won ' t put up with the side effects on a daily basis since I spent a long time getting rid of a reflux problem in the past .


The abdominal gas , cramps and discomfort are another thing I don ' t want to see get worse if I keep taking Arthrotec .
1,1,4,4 ADR|1,1,6,6 ADR|1,2 ADR

I ' ve taken Tylenol 3 and never had a problem like this .


Perhaps there is something not right yet with Arthrotec .


Have suffered from leg cramps ( principally at night ) since beginning 40 mg Lipitor , 5 years ago , after a mild heart attack .
3,4 ADR

Cardiologist offered no suggestions .


After trying numerous recommendation for this problem such as potassium , magnesium , vitamin E , etc with no effect , my family doctor suggested that I stop taking Lipitor for 3 days , and see if it has any effect .


The effect was dramatic .


The cramps did not occur during the night after I did not take the 40 mg with my dinner .
1,1 ADR

They also did not occur on the following two nights .


I did not want to restart the Lipitor ( once a day with the evening meal ) for fear that the cramps would just as quickly return .
21,21 ADR

Since it was possible that the reason why the night cramps ceased so quickly is that I was taking the 40 mg entirely in the evening , I decided to split the pills and take half in the morning and half in the evening .

I ' ve been on it over a year now .


It significantly lowered my cholesterol within 3 months , which shocked me .


To be fair , I am on 3 other medications , so if I was to have any side effects I wouldn ' t know what to attribute it to anyway .


But so far so excellent .

Very bad not for my body type .


Came off it to see what happens .


I am trying some other things to control the bad cholesterol - change of diet , exercise and some other natural things .


By stopping Lipitor my quality of life has returned .


My bad cholesterol is fine for now the same as a normal persons reading but not as low as the doctors would like it .


Who would think such a drug can do so much harm and is recommended by the family doctor .


It does lower cholesterol but it also is a major contributor to other health problems .


My doctor switched me from Pravachol to Lipitor almost a year ago because of a study that was done in CHF patients and when Lipitor was used , hospitalizations were cut almost in half .


Normally I have to go into the hospital a minimum of 2 times a year .


Since I started taking Lipitor , I have not been in the hospital even once !


Also , he also told me that Lipitor was better for my kidneys than the statins .

For me I believe that this drug is a poison .


My doctor gave me a low 10 mg . dose so it took several months of slowly getting sick to be almost incapacitated .


Do yourself a favor , its called diet .

Took Lipitor for about 8 years to reduce cholesterol from 240 to 160 .


On advice of physician added Tricor 145 mg to reduce trigycerides from 330 .


Combination was very effective - cholesterol to 140 , triglycerides to 150 .


Side effects increased noticeably a few months after starting tricor .


About 4 months after starting tricor , spent a day of heavy physical exertion ( shoveling snow ) .


Immediately afterward side effects increased dramatically , severe muscle pain , burning , cramps , exhaustion , mild nausea , inability to concentrate .

would prefer to try Niacin - will NEVER take Lipitor again .


worked very well ; it took about a month for noticeable results , but the relief was definite and lasting .


I stopped taking it after 4 - 5 months - shoulder remained ok , but many lesser aches and pains ( back , knees , etc ) returned .


Clearly , there was a systemic effect that was helpful as well .

I happen to have Endometriosis that has attached to " everything " in the backside , including my Sciatic nerve .


Sciatic Endo is rarely seen , but they found it in me .


I do Restorative Yoga postures to get myself loosened up every day , but keep the Cataflam handy as nothing works better for the pain , unless I have an extremely bad time where I have to take a Demerol with it ( rarely ) .


However , I have noticed in the " patient info " they give with my Rx that now warnings of NSAID ' s causing heart attacks and strokes are written where they were not before when I started this Rx .


The best dose for me ( per my doctor ) is 2 pills to get in your system , then 1 every 8 hours afterward .


Luckily , I only need this a few days a week at the most , here & there .


I highly recommend this especially for lower lumbar arthritis and to women for dysmennorhea .


it will do the trick ! .

I have been on this medication for approximately two years and it has been very affective in lowering my cholesterol ; however , I did notice that I became depressed with intermittent muscle pain .
29,29 ADR|32,33 ADR

I recently mentioned this to my physician and asked if he knew if this particular medication causes these symptoms as all my blood studies for liver function , etc have been normal .


I decided to stop the Lipitor and within a few days I felt so much better .


I will call him tomorrow and ask if I can be switched to another medication .


It is a very effective medication , but obviously has its problems as indicated by those patients who had very similar effects .


I was taking 75 mg only once every three or four days .


At first it was miraculous , no pain .


I felt fabulous , except I did notice mild headache .

I still have to take it in combo with a stronger pain reliever , but it ' s just a good drug for aches and pains .


Better than things like Vioxx and OTC stuff , for sure .

My cholesterol went from 398 to 260 on 40 Lipitor .


This year I was given 80 mgs of Lipitor and Zetia was added as well .

Lipitor works , but for me it was at a terrible cost to my quality of life .


At first , I had no problems .


Problems began gradually and I never put it together until my GYN said STOP taking Lipitor !


Over this time , I gradually began to feel like an old , old lady and I was taking medication for arthritis and being tested for sorgren ' s syndrome .

diuretics taken to relieve edema caused cholesterol to go higher and M .

12,12 ADR

Stopped taking Lipitor and I haven ' t felt better .


I noticed a difference within a week .


These drugs are poison and should be taken off the market .


I am now taking CoQ 10 with Vitamin E to try and heal my body .


From all the reading I have done , the doctor should have told me to take this because the statins deplete your body of CoQ 10 .

I was on the toilet for a good 30 minutes in extreme pain .

Then when the pain subsided I begin to have some bleeding and I was on day 12 of my cycle .
10,19 ADR|3,3 ADR

I would rather die than take this drug again .


Although It works wonders for my back pain , it is not worth it to go through the uterus pain and cramping .
18,21 ADR

I am going to try and find a sister drug to arthrotec .


Its weird because I have been taking this drug off and on for about 4 months and this only has happened to me 3 times , but I have no way of knowing when it will randomly happen and it is not worth it to take that risk .


I have began to think it has something to do with the day of my cycle affecting how bad the pains will be .


Mostly Tingling / burning in arms and legs and back of neck , Some lightheadedness , some memory loss , some chest pain , pain in shoulder - feels like arm pulled out of socket .

Lowered my cholesterol from 270 to 180 in a month .


LDL and triglycerides dropped to 100 .


I need to take this due to bad family history , but not sure how much I can take .


The side effects are very distracting .


I have been on this for a month and so far I am tolerating this , but if the side effects get worse , I would have to decide if dying at 60 from a heart attack is worse than living in misery until 80 .


My feet feel like I have stone bruises just in front of the heel .
0,13 ADR

My hips hurt on both sides when I get up .
0,5 ADR

My doctor noticed a rough sound in my lungs and a heart murmur that was never mentioned before .

I was OK taking 20 mg but the doctor raised me to 40 mg about 4 months ago .


It ' s only since then that I ' ve had these symptoms .


I ' ll probably quit completely though .

The week I started to take I had the chest ache , confirmed to be muscular by doctors .
9,10 ADR

At the start of the second week , I accidentally took a dose in the morning instead of the night because I took the wrong pill ( skipped the night dose ) .


The day after I started to have the other symptons .


The worst one - the mouth one has faded , but the others remain .


I found out too late grapefruit juice can make this drug stronger .


I drank it some days during the first 2 weeks .


Stopped drinking it .


At the beginning of third week I took 50 mg of CoQ 10 per day for 3 days .


I couldn ' t sense an improvement , but after stopping for other three days I will try again .


( I need better evidence before buying a can of CoQ 10 , it is very expensive and hard to find around here ) .


Will beg my cardiologist to let me try natural exercise before continuing statins .


Giving it a 3 , because it was effective , in a single month and with ezetimibe and exercise all my numbers are in very safe ranges .


Please be careful about natural supplements .


Homeopathy simply does not work - it is just water - The supplements that do work may also have side effects , just like the drugs .


Red Yeast Rice , for example , actually contains a statin ( lovastatin ) , so it will most likely have all the set of side effects as the other statins .


I have been on Lipitor for over a year and it did lower my cholesterol from 299 to 220 , but I , too , have been having side effects , I guess now , that might be attributed to Lipitor .


I have this weird dizzy / vertigo / un - balanced - type feeling sometimes .
4,4 ADR|6,6 ADR|8,13 ADR

It is a feeling like I need to hold on to something , in order to make my walk across a large area , like an airport .

I also have arthritic knees , hands that are numb and tingling at times .
3,4 ADR|6,6,9,9 ADR|6,6,11,11 ADR

I think since being on this drug , my arms are always falling asleep while I ' m sleeping .

I don ' t know whether all this is related to being on Lipitor , but after reading some of this posts on this site , it is beginning to make me wonder ! .


Possible body stiffness and joint pain .
1,2 ADR|4,5 ADR

I went from a vigorous woman who two years ago spent two weeks walking all over London and Paris , whose favorite hobby was hiking , etc , to a fragile , crippled crone who , for a while , was certain I belonged in a wheel chair , due to the effects of this horrible , killer medication after having hip replacement surgery .


Every muscle from my waist down was effected , my legs became LEAD , my bladder all but quit working ; blood began showing up in my urine , I had every test in the book , went to doctor after doctor , and no one recognized this medication as the problem , until I finally went to a neurologist for my back problems .
0,7 ADR|9,12 ADR|14,19 ADR|21,27 ADR|62,63 ADR

I could not walk ten steps without the most excruciating pain and fatigue , all I ever wanted to do was to sleep or at least lay down .

I lost all interest in everything , had no energy for anything but the most basics .
1,5 ADR|7,9 ADR

I quit taking Lipitor , ON MY OWN , in August of 2001 .


I experienced a certain amount of immediate relief , and my bladder began working normally again , but still have horrible after - effects , and I don ' t know if they will ever go away .


I feel the muscles in my legs will never regain their previous strength , I have constant back pain , I cannot walk a half a block without extreme muscle fatigue and pain in my thighs , calves and buttocks , and I still am experiencing malaise that was never present before .
16,18 ADR|28,30 ADR|32,34,37,37 ADR|32,34,39,39 ADR|32,35 ADR|46,46 ADR

I consider myself lucky to be alive ! ! .


The more I hear , the more I think people need to be made aware of the dangerous side effects , particularly the effects surgery has on anyone taking Lipitor .


This is one of the most dangerous medications on the market ! .


Took for 2 weeks .


Towards the end , began getting tightness in my throat , tingling eyes and lips .
6,9 ADR|11,12 ADR

These symptoms worsened over the following two weeks , especially the tightness in my throat until a severe case resulted in me colapsing from a heart attack and hospitalised for a week .
25,26 ADR

Would never use it again or reccommend it .


mussel twitches every where mussel spasms and cramps .
0,1 ADR|4,4,7,7 ADR|4,5 ADR

1,2 ADR|5,6 ADR|22,23 ADR|26,26 ADR|33,33 ADR|31,31 ADR

I have taken it for a long time and only in the last year have these symptoms occurred - perhaps these are long - term usage effects .


I don ' t know why this drug is even being allowed to be sold ! .


I have vaginal bleeding and cramping .
2,3 ADR|5,5 ADR

.


.


it ' s taken me almost a week to realize this bleeding is due to the medication .


The bleeding started almost immediately after taking the first dose .


I initially thought I was having my period ( even though it was not time ) .


If anyone can give me info regarding how long this bleeding and cramping lasts , I would appreciate it .


NONE .


I BELIEVE THIS DRUG IS AN EXCELLENT ONE .


STARTED TAKING IT ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN GIVEN TO ME BY MY CARDIOLOGIST .


NO IMMEDIATE OR SIDE EFFECTS NOTED SINCE STARTING .


HOWEVER , ON MY LIPID BLOOD TEST FOUR MONTHS LATER , WOW WHAT AN IMPROVEMENT .


IT NOT ONLY MARKEDLY KNOCKED MY BAD CHOLESTEROL DOWN BUT I WOULD SAY IT WAS A MONUMENTAL ACHIEVEMENT .


WHEREAS TOTAL CHOLESTEROL HAD BEEN OVER 200 PREVIOUSLY , NOW IT WAS ONLY 151 AND THE BAD PORTION .


I THINK HDL .


WAS JUST 54 .


I AM WELL SATISFIED .


I AM AWARE OF SOME COMPLAINTS AND SPECULATION BY OTHERS BUT I AM GOING TO KEEP TAKING IT .

In the past 2 weeks the toes ( esp . the big toe ) on my left foot have started to twitch .

This is really scaring me because my father had Parkinson ' s .


Also , in the last couple of days , I have started to get pain between my shoulder blades .
14,18 ADR

I have not had my cholesterol tested since I started taking it ; but I am stopping it today .


It seems to work great for some people .


But everyone should be very vigilant and check out any changes immediately .


It is too easy to attribute a change to a pulled muscle or aging , etc Thanks for this website .

Some in arms .


At times pain so bad I can hardly move or walk with a limp as I favor the bad leg .
2,4 ADR

Works for cholesterol , but if these are the side effects , I think I ' ll take my chances with the cholesterol - doesn ' t make sense to have low cholesterol if I can ' t move or do anything else .


occasionally some leg cramps ( in lower left leg only ) if taken too late in the day .
2,3 ADR

No side effects if taken before noon .


This drug has helped tremendously with aches and discomfort from the arthritis .


Totally cured the pain in my foot from tendonitis and plantar fasciitis .


Has been all OK until recently when I started to get " fluey " feelings in upper arms , legs etc
11,19 ADR

As I had just recently had flu jab thought this was the cause .


However the symptoms persisted , GP said " just flu jab " - but after 4 weeks !


Noticed today after leaving Artrotec off for a day or so , that things were much better until I took one dose .


fluey feelings returned within a hour .
0,1 ADR

I ' ve taken co - codamol for my fibromyalgia for many years which I have very few side effects with .


I ' ve recently had this severe hip pain on both sides which the co codamol wasn ' t touching so I went back to the Dr He recommended this anti - inflamatory and as he said next stop would be cortozone injections I was willing to give it a try .


I ' ve tried it for a week but it makes me feel dreadful .
12,13 ADR

Every time I stand up I have to hold onto something for fear of falling over , I feel sick and light headed and I get those waves of nausea where you suddenly feel all clammy .
29,29 ADR|12,15 ADR|19,19 ADR|21,22 ADR|33,35 ADR

It ' s very much like having a permanent hangover , even down to the hunger which until I read thsi site I hadn ' t connected to the rest of it .
8,9 ADR|15,15 ADR

I ' ve felt no discernible difference in the pain in my hips and the side effects simply aren ' t worth it so thats it for me and this drug .


stiff neck , tightness in shoulders , muscle pain .
0,1 ADR|3,5 ADR|7,8 ADR

I started taking Lipitor in December 2009 and stopped after 4 months .

Ice and ibruprofen gel help but only for a short while .


I have been taking 400 mg Ibruprofen 3 times daily for a couple of weeks on my doctors advice without .


This drug is clearly POISON to so many people and perhaps there is good reason to take Pfizer to the courts .


However I do believe that any Doctor prescribing Lipitor should make it abundantly clear to the patient that very serious consequences could ensue that would cause extreme pain and could effect quality of life .
26,27 ADR

I believe that failure to do so is a serious deriliction of duty that should be tested with complaints to the medical authorities that oversee our doctors and / or the courts .


My elder brother , who has expired 15 days back in the age of 54 years , was put on the same medicine for blood pressure in the age of 45 years which definitely resulted into causing him ALS in the last three years before his tragic death without any cure .

I strongly feel the lipitor had the crucial side effect upon my brother causing him to suffer with ALS for which there is reportedly no cure in Allopathy , while therefore i put my brother on Homeopathitic treatment which at least avoided the bad effect .

Experienced some leg muscle discomfort , but went away within a few weeks .

In June , I ran out of my prescription , was busy , forgetful , stupid and didn ' t request a refill until about 2 weeks later .


It took another week to get the prescription because I had switched doctors and the pharmacy didn ' t follow up .


Anyway , after 3 weeks or so of not taking Lipitor , I started it again .


Now a week later , I feel like I ' ve been run over by a truck .


I started having extreme muscle discomfort , achiness , cramps .


I assumed it was due to my half - marathon training .

During the day if I squatted ( e . g . in the garden ) or tried to get on a ladder I got foot / leg cramps .
24,24,27,27 ADR|26,27 ADR

I mentioned it to my doctor who said it couldn ' t possibly be related to the Lipitor .


It kept getting worse and worse - legs began feeling very tired , couldn ' t go up stairs easily , had cramping events in my legs 3 - 4 times a day .

I took 5 mg / day of Lipitor for a year but finally quit as my legs were hurting too much .

Thanks to this site .


Stopping it pronto !


Needs to be banned .


Warnings should be discussed with pharmacist face to face when this is prescribed and before taking it .


Should be scrutinized from the first pill .


This greatly improved the swelling when I had a surgery on both legs .


There weren ' t any side effects .


maybe a little gas but may not be related to the drug .
2,3 ADR

I would recommend this to anyone that has swelling of any sort to help heal an injury .


The doctor did say to only take it 5 days though because it reduces mucus in the stomach and it can cause extreme stomach pain if taken too long .


I have been taking Lipitor for at least 5 years and lately I have had very bad muscle pain and fatique not knowing why .
15,18 ADR|20,20 ADR

I am type 11 diabetic and my doctor put me on Lipitor to keep my cholestrol down .

I stumbled across this website which was nothing short of a miracle to me .


I was searching for answers on why I am in such pain throughout my body , mental confusion at times and also short term memory loss which all seemed to be growing steadily worse for the past few years .
11,14 ADR|16,17 ADR|22,25 ADR

I blamed it on stress ( with a dying husband ) , arthritis , advancing age etc and even discussed leg pain and body cramps with my doctor which he attributed chiefly to age and arthritis .
20,21 ADR|23,24 ADR

I even had tests done on arteries to see if that could be the cause as I have an aortic aneurysem and thought perhaps my problems could be from poor circulation or blockage somewhere .


They all checked out okay .


It has been unbearable for several weeks now off and on and I suffered fatigue , lack of energy and growing depression and a feeling a fragility where I had always been a strong woman until recent years .
14,14 ADR|16,18 ADR|20,21 ADR|24,26 ADR

I looked up fibromyalgia thinking I might have that but when I casually looked up lipitor the ratings leaped out at me .


These people all were experiencing my symptoms ! ! !


THANK YOU for providing this web site it may very well have saved my life .


I am contacting my doctor immediately and as of now no more lipitor .


It did lower my cholestral but greatly lowered my quality of life and I guess I am going to do exercise and have joined weight watchers and see if I can control it in that manner .


I am 67 and have been on Lipitor for several years with the symptoms growing steadily until now unbearable .

I had severe endometriosis and adenomyosis all my life , plus the impairment in blood clotting due to EDS , so my doctor probably should not have prescribed this drug .

Cymbalta 120 mg per day helps enough with the pain .


I started Lipitor more than two years ago .


Cholesterol levels were just right .


However , about a month ago , I started to feel leg pain / spasm / weakness / depressed / suicidal , joint pain and so forth .

If you feel any of the symptoms , please dicontinue this drug .


I experienced lightheadedness , depression , short term memory problems .
2,2 ADR|4,4 ADR|6,9 ADR

The worst side effects by far were the severe muscle pains and cramps , especially in my shins , front of my thighs , feet and hands .
8,10 ADR|12,12 ADR

I noticed that they usually began about an hour after taking the Lipitor and would continue for several hours into the night .


I was on Lipitor 2 years when I noticed that on a day that I had forgotten to take it , that I didn ' t experience the severe pains .
28,29 ADR

I experimented by taking the medication one night and then not taking it the next .


Sure enough , every night I took the medication I had the severe cramps / pains but the nights I didn ' t take it , either I didn ' t experience the pain at all or it was at a much lesser degree .

I notified my doctor .


She stopped the Lipitor and suggested that I try Red Yeast Rice instead .


It has given good results with no side effects .

I was started on Liptor 20 mg 7 years ago .


It was increased to 40 mg .


3 years ago .


The pain increased proportionately to the time I was on the drug and the dose increase .
1,1 ADR

Neither my doctors nor I ever related these pains to Lipitor .


I stopped Lipitor six months ago as an experiment .


Within 3 weeks I had recovered about 50 % .


I hve not recovered past this point .


I still can ' t walk without extreme pain .


I have to wear ankle supports , night splints , ice compresses frequently , gel pads , elevated heels .


My shoulders are doing better than my ankles and feet , but they still hurt .


My GP and the surgeon who says I now need surgery on both ankles for the inflammed bursae are reluctant to connect my pain and disability .


My GP still wants me on statins .


She is annoyed that I will not take any .


I am taking Red Yeast Rice with COQ 10 now instead of a statin along with 2000 mg of Vitamin C daily .


Basically Lipitor has ruined my formerly active life .


No more dancing , golf , hiking , even standing too long sets my ankles on fire .


I will have my cholesterol rechecked in September to see if the Red Yeast Rice helps my elevated cholesterol .


I was never warned that any of the symptoms I have experienced were in any way related to Lipitor .


Acid Reflux , stomach pain , muscle pain , trouble with liver count .

1,1 ADR|10,10 ADR

A research article in JAMA , 2004 ; 291 : 2243 - 2252 concludes this : .


Lipitor reduced my readings to almost normal .


At the same time I suffered from fibromyalgia .


The pain all over my body got worse as time went on .
1,5 ADR

I noticed that when I left my Lipitor at home when I was on vacation or other trip , that I began to feel better .


My doctor told me there was a remote possibility that the Lipitor was agravating the fibromyalgia .


I stopped taking Lipitor and feel so much better !


But , it seems I buggered up my stomach from all the pain killers that I took .


What to do next ? .


Please be carefull with this drug and watch for all types of body pain , .

Get off of it if you can .


the muscle spasms in my legs were so bad I had difficulty climbing 4 stairs - highly unusual for me .
1,2 ADR

you need to keep on top of these drugs because the dr . doesn ' t always monitor enough .


I wouldn ' t have known what was wrong with me if I hadn ' t seen an ad on t . v . for this med . describing side effects .


Dr said it was vitamin C deficiency .


I stopped the lipitol and the symptoms went away .


I would have believed the dr . if it weren ' t for a kind pharmacist who said I should get a second opinion .


After only 3 weeks on 10 mg of Lipitor I called my Dr to discontinue .


I have recently begun a workout regimine 6 days a week doing elliptical training and weight training .


After workouts I would be so tired to the point where I was going to bed at 8 pm ( I ' m normally a night - owl ) .


I was mostly feeling drained and tired which was unusual for me and didn ' t feel that way previous to taking the drug .

but have already slept better than I had in the 3 wks on it .


Don ' t know if it worked to lower my cholesterol since I wasn ' t on it for the 6 wks to do the bloodwork .


I am going to try to lower it naturally through exercise and diet instead of the drug .


not sure it ' s worth the side effects .


Stay in tune with your body .


I elected to discontinue immediately with onset of side effects .


Will consider other alternatives .

I need to be able to pass a physical readiness test , including a 1 . 5 mile run , every 6 months because I ' m in the military .


I took myself off Lipitor because I can not take the physical readiness test .


In fact I need a cane in the morning to get out of bed .


I am not overweight .


I was told to stretch and exercise more but that has not helped my symptoms , which have continued to worsen .


Until recently I walked to work and shopping , 4 or 5 miles most weekdays , and more on the weekends .


I also ran 2 miles , 3 times a week .


Now I have difficulty walking and problems with my balance and I ' ve gained 10 pounds because I ' ve become sedentary .

Two days after taking myself off Lipitor my feet have improved a little and I ' m looking forward to resuming a more active lifestyle .

After 2 months being on Lipitor I experienced extreme pain and loss of muscle in left leg .
8,9 ADR|11,16 ADR

Advice from Cardiologist was to immediately stop taking Liptitor .


It was too late , resulting in the loss of being able to work and ended up disabitlity and would like to join a class action lawsuit against the drug company responsible .

For me , it has been very effective pain relief for my chronic bone / joint pain from a broken elbow .


So effective that I was able to substantially reduce the amount of narcotic pain reliever I was using once the Voltaren kicked in after about 2 days .


For the most part , no side effects .


Some gas early on , which has subsided .
1,1 ADR

I do have some weight around the middle which I wasn ' t noticing so much before , but this may be due to fact I ' m now in my early 40 ' s .

Some darkness in urine , but I think it ' s due to not enough fluids .

Liver enzymes became elevated after taking the cholesterol - lowering medicines ( Mevacor and Lipitor ) for approximately 9 years .


The Lipitor was great at lowering my cholesterol and improving the ratio of my HDL ' s to LDL ' s ; however , on the advice of my doctor I have discontinued taking Lipitor for the time being .


I didn ' t realize that I haven ' t been feeling well , until I stopped taking the Lipitor and now feel like my old self again .

I also watched my mother - on - law and her brother both start and stop the drug due to extreme fatigue and muscle pain .


It is the WORST DRUG EVER MADE , and the cost of it both in terms of money and emotional and physical pain does not justify the handful of heart attackes it * might * prevent .


Do yourself a favor - buy some fish oil and some flush - free niacin to treat your cholesterol , and run like hell away from Lipitor ! ! ! .

thats when the severe muscle pain started and very debillitating - I went to a rheumotogologist thinking it was lupus or fibromalgyia as i felt like I always had the flu and she took a blood test and said I had muscle damage from the Lipitor .
3,5 ADR|23,30 ADR|41,42 ADR

Do the benefits outweigh the severe side effects - Pfizer says it ' s rare but serious side effects - I know many people that have had the same problem with muscle damage so I would not consider the side effect to be rare and now since I ' m off the drug wonder how much permanent damage to my muscles is their due to this awful drug .

Instead of taking the pill 2 X daily , as prescribed I take it at most once per day , usually about 3 - 4 times per week , but often skipping a week or two at a time .


My arthritis has been under control for years and only causes me trouble if I skip taking the pills for about a month .

I have been suffering with severe swolen / inflamation of the fingers / hand & wrist pain for 8 months and attributed it to new blood pressure medicine or arthritis ; however , after going off the new blood pressure meds for 5 weeks , I have noticed no remarkable change and have had blood work and x - rays indicating NO arthritis .
5,13 ADR|15,16 ADR

But now after finding this site , I ' m wondering if it has been the Lipitor all along all of a sudden after taking it for 7 . 5 years .


I am discontinuing the Lipitor immediately to see if I can find any change and relief .


I agree with so many of you in saying that no cholesterol lowering drug is worth this kind of result !

I felt like an old ( older ) man during this period , I thought I was finished in terms of my trade and the things I enjoy most , like hiking .
1,8 ADR

My prescription of lipitor ran out a few months after these tests were done .


I didn ' t bother refilling it right away and noticed my knees and elbows felt better .


I renewed the prescription and no sooner had I started taking it again that I felt the stiff joints return .
17,18 ADR

So I stopped taking it , the stiffness goes away , started again , stiffness returns .
7,7 ADR|14,14 ADR

After telling my doctor this story , right away he says oh yeah , that ' s probably right Pardon ! ?


So why didn ' t you mention that possibility before all the tests ?


( luckily since I live in Canada , these tests were all covered by our health care system ) I didn ' t make the connection to lipitor earlier because stiff , swollen joints were not listed as one of the side effects .


Sore muscles yes , stiff swollen joints , no .


I can see the class action suits coming against Pfizer .

Pfizer Inc . ( maker of Lipitor ) AMOUNT AT ISSUE : $ $ $ Pending , Cholesterol - Fighting Drug Tied to Liver , Kidney Injury , The Kahn Gauthier Law Group is investigating possible legal actions against Pfizer Inc . , the manufacturer of the cholesterol - lowering drug Lipitor ( atorvastatin ) , to recover for liver or kidney damage suffered by patients prescribed Lipitor .


Like other drugs in its class ( the statins ) , Lipitor can cause elevated liver enzymes .


In clinical trials , this occurred in 0 . 7 percent of the patients , but the rate was much higher for those taking the 80 mg dose .


Another serious side effect of Lipitor and other statins is a condition called rhabdomyolysis , in which muscle cells break down and release potentially toxic cell contents into the bloodstream . ,


Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain , tenderness and weakness - - most commonly in the calves and lower back .


Malaise , fever , dark urine , vomiting and nausea can also be symptoms .


The most feared consequence of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney failure , occurring in 30 - 40 % of the cases .


Some of the warning signs of liver failure are nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite , dark urine , and generalized skin discoloration .


For more information on this case , you should become a member of ClassActionAmerica .

10 mg taken


The drug does lower the cholesterol reading but as I have also made diet changes and lifestyle changes - not sure if all due to drug or own common sense .


I was not as aware of dangers as I am now and would not have taken it if not advised by MD .


I aim to stop taking it .


none .


but soon as i started it the staticy feeling in my abdomin stopped and the hot feelings i usually suffered from when that static would start had ceased with it .


i feel much better .


it drove my cholesterol down to almost perfect levels .


of course if you behave with your diet .


AND if the medication doesn ' t make you sick .


if you feel better taking it you ' ve hit the jack pot .


i ' ve heard so many who suffer bad cramps and chest pains with this medication .


i ' ve lucked out .


though i ' ve had unsuccessful endeavors with another medication pertaining to triglycerides .


but lipitor has actually made me feel much better from a problem i ' ve suffered feeling as a child .


abdominal irritation or a sensation that feels like electricity zapping around my midsection and used to make me feel hot and irritable .


soon as i took lipitor that all stopped .


i ' m very happy something helped that .


i was tired of feeling strange when it came to my gut .

Severe pain in my calf muscles in my legs started about 7 months after taking the drug .

My doctor kept me on it and insisted this was a common side effect .


I complained for several months and then he switched me to another drug ( Crestor ) and the problems persisted .


He then switched me to ( Zochor ) .


Finally I informed my doctor the pain was too severe and I was stopping as I found I could not even walk in the morning !

I have had surgery but to no avail .


I still have some form of pain daily .

Before Lipitor I was in excellent shape and exercised regularly with no issues at all .

5,5 ADR

I was taking Red Yeast statins for chlolesterol of 230 , but then big - pharma got in the picture and made that illegal .


Don ' t know if that is still the case .


My doctor said Lipitor was the most tested statin drug .


My real concern is heart disease which is in my family .


Not sure of how tight the correlation is between low chlosterol numbers and low risk of coronary problems .


AMA dumbs down the information to make is sound like getting down to ridiculous levels ( 100 ) insures that you won ' t have problems .


I doubt it .


Probably much more based on genetic history .


So Lipitor is great for reducing your numbers , but extending your life ? ? ? .


Have not experienced any side not even a rise in bp .


Have been taking off and on for over three years .


Not addictive .


Sometimes take on empty stomach with no adverse side effects .

I kept asking my doctor if there were any side effects like mine and he said no .


I had been taking zocor with no problem but insurance company wouldn ' t pay for it anymore and made me go on lipitor .


After about six months I had my docteor write a letter to ins . co . saying I couldn ' t take lipitor and they agreed to put me back on zocor .


But the long term effect of those six months sent me into a psyhcological tailspin that I never recovered from .
13,14 ADR

I went to three psychiatrist and they finally came up with a diagnoses of bipolar disorder .


Cause unknown .


This was three years ago .


The drug ruined my life , I am now seperated after this all occurred and before the lipitor I was an energtic happy family man with a great wife and two kids .


I know it was the lipitor because the only other medication I take is an aspirin once a day .


Started taking Lipitor 3 months ago .

Several friends mentioned the same weight gain problem .
5,6 ADR

Had no side effects , liver tests always normal .


Would give it a ' 5 ' , but it isn ' t the best med for me .


Triglycerides and cholesterol were getting worse every year ; diet / exercise did not help much .


First on Lopid ( Gemfibrozil ) which worked OK , but had gall bladder out as a result !


Doc put me on Lipitor .


While it did help get the overall numbers down somewhat , I am still very high .


( Untreated TG 1700 ; w / drug 700 - 1100 .


Chol too high to measure came down to 280 - 350 .


Cardiologist now switching me to Tricor ( scary ) which is working better for my particular situation , but not as pleasant to take .


Cannot be sure it is the drug , but around the time I was on it a month , began having pain on outer sides of thighs .
21,26 ADR

Knowing some cholesterol meds can cause leg pain my doc did some kind of check on me and said it was not the drug .


Still have those pains , not terrible , just feel like I have been hiking uphill and am fatigued there .
3,3 ADR

Has done a very good job keeping cholesterol down .


I am going to request lowering the dose w / the doc .


Did not help to lower my cholesterol , 55 put on 60 pounds .

2,2 ADR|4,6 ADR|15,15 ADR|19,19 ADR|21,21 ADR|17,17 ADR

Arthrotec seemed to induce my menstrual cramps and cause the pain to be severe .
5,6 ADR|10,10,13,13 ADR

I would not recommend this drug to anyone , especially since I have never had such an adverse reaction to any other medication .


Also , I would caution women not to take this medication while menstruating , since one side effect can be severe menstual pain .
20,22 ADR

No problems with this drug .

Prescribed physical therapy which made it hurt even more .


I first noticed the pain several months in to taking the drug .

After an ER visit due to severe back spasm / cramp , my Cardiologist suggested going off the drug and in the past 10 days , no cramping , the shoulder pain has eased 80 % and I actually feel good .
6,8 ADR|10,10 ADR|30,31 ADR

Because of blockage issues I need to move on to another drug like Crestor or Zocar but after reading some of the comments I am concerned .


The medication worked at lowering my cholesterol ( 127 with good cholesterol over 40 and bad cholesterol under 70 ) but at a steep price physically .


left side of jaw itches , left shoulder aches and tingles left leg iliotial band syndrome .
0,4 ADR|6,7,10,10 ADR|6,8 ADR|11,15 ADR

Cholesterol way down .


No problems that I can associate with the drug .


Does not appear to be giving me negative side effects .


My ordeal began with leg problems long before my bypass and any drugs were taken .


After surgery I was given list of drugs of which Lipitor was one .


I take 80 mg . / day at night along with asprin , 100 mg of Atenolol and a host of others .


Sorry to say my leg pains have not went away , and by reading many of these postings it appears to exaggerate this condition .


Doctors looking elsewhere but have found nothing .


I found information about leg pains being caused by restless leg syndrome .


I sure hope I don ' t have that !


Started at 262 , after 8 months down to 108 .


Lipitor diet and excercise have lowered my cholestrol .


Weak legs , lack of concentration , slurred speach , loss of balance and loss of short term memory .

I have been off Lipitor for 2 months now and still get sore and weak legs and can barely remember anything that has happened recently : ( .

I quit taking the Statin drug 2 years ago .


I went to American Heart lung ass . website and put in my 10 year risk factor .


By dropping my total cholesterol from 259 down to 200 only reduced my risk factor by 1 % .


I showed this and other info to my Doctor and she understood and said it was my choice .


I feel normal today and will never take these drugs again .


Here is site to check your risk factor . http : / / www . fda . gov / opacom / backgrounders / problem . html


Also I found out you should report side effects to FDA at . http : / / www . fda . gov / opacom / backgrounders / problem . html


They estimate only 20 % to 30 % of drug side effects get reported .


I encourage everyone to report their experiences with these drugs .


( We have to the Doctors don ' t ) .


These Statins are dangerous over perscribed drugs .


I am menstruating with heavy bleeding every 11 days .
2,8 ADR

Honestly , I can ' t figure out how I can lose this much blood and still function .


I have horrific cramps to begin with , so I can ' t say whether arthrotec increased that .
2,3 ADR

I have endometriosis , so I ' m not sure if that is something that doesn ' t agree with arthrotec .


It did help with the pain I experience with the pinched nerve , but it is not worth it to me to continue .

developed parkinson ' s disease .


discovered thru 23 andme DNA profiling I possess a mutation in a gene , SLCO 1 B 1 , that codes a transport protein responsible for moving statins into the liver to be detoxified .


Studies have noted patients with greatly incrased plasma statin levels ( > 134 % and AUCs more than 400 % ABOVE NORMAL ) toxic levels indeed .


The neurological damage I have suffered due to toxic levels of lipitor seems to be permanent .
1,2 ADR

Nothing I have tried has reversed the extreme symptoms .


in the beginning megadoses of coenzyme Q 10 did help ; that was 6 yrs ago .


the deterioration continues .


the slco 1 b 1 mutation IS NOT rare , occurring in 26 - 34 % of caucasian poulation , less in african am , and more in Asian pop .


seems many individuals with the mutation ( s ) develop severe myalgias and myopathies , prompting discontinuance of the statin .
10,11 ADR|13,13 ADR

for those of us who did not suffer the muscle dmaage , neurodegeneration is what occurs in my opinion .

I took Lipitor for 2 years and 9 months before I finally made the connection after a myriad of tests showed no other reason for my array of symptoms .


Since then , I have done extensive research on statins and would warn anybody on them to watch out .


Make sure you take supplemental CoQ - 10 along with a statin .


If you start to have any muscle problems , quit the drug while you still have a chance .


My life has been changed completely for the worse and I will probably never completely recover from the damage caused by Lipitor .


None that I noticed .


I did take my blood pressure today though , and it was slightly elevated from the norm .
4,5,12,13 ADR

I suspect the drug is responsible , but as I am only taking it short - term , I am not overly concerned .


I had acute shoulder tendonitis and was in absolute agony .


Within 24 hours of taking this medicine , the inflammation was reduced dramatically and I have continued to improve , gaining back more of my range of motion with each day .


migrane headaches , very very blurry vision , at times felt like i ' m going blind , severe muscle pain and dizziness .
0,1 ADR|3,6 ADR|8,16 ADR|18,20 ADR|22,22 ADR

call your physician to change medicine immediately if you ' ve side effects like mine as this is what I did .

If I miss a day , headaches begin to creep in .


Tried many others , this seemed to work best for quite some time .


No day is pain free , though .


Not bad on stomach - always take w / milk or food .


This is genetic for me , so NSAIDs will be in my life for a while .


but fear long - term use of this one .


My brother experienced memory loss and paranoia , leading to a uncharacteristic suicide .
3,4 ADR|6,6 ADR|12,12 ADR

He also seems to have had hallucinations .
6,6 ADR

Extremely dangerous drug .


Severe myalgia .
0,1 ADR

Symptoms developed and progressed gradually , but stopped within one week of stopping Lipitor .


Very effective at lowering cholesterol but if you are prone to muscle inflammation or other connective tissue pain ( due to rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia for example ) I would be very cautious .


My symptoms developed gradually enough that I assumed I was relapsing with rheumatoid arthritis - - I was astounded to find the problem was Lipitor .


I had lesser problems with Pravochol but have come to distrust all statins .


I am focusing on diet , time - release naicin , and fish oil instead .


immediate and excellent reduction in LDLs .

An absolute miracle drug for me .


None of the stomach issues others seem to have .


I was at the point where I was becoming highly immobile and in constant pain .


Started taking arthrotec and had IMMEDIATE relief .


honestly never thought I would feel that way again .


recently pain has started to increase though , and not sure if I ' ve overworked my back .


or if I ' m becoming intolerant .


Have recommended to two others who have had similar exceptional results for chronic arthritic type issues .


After a routine check up my cholesterol level was found to be sky high .


So two months ago the internist put me on Lipitor for high cholesterol .


The lipitor helped in reducing the cholesterol level by 20 % .


The side effects were terrible !


I had for a number of years pain in my hipjoints .
7,10 ADR

The lipitor increased the pain tenfold .
4,4 ADR

I could hardly walk , sit or drive the car .


The pain I was experiencing especially around the hipjoints was incredible .
1,1,6,8 ADR

I told the specialist about these side - effects and he told me to reduce the dose from 1 a day to 1 every two days ! ?


I had already stopped taking the lipitor for a week and the pain had decreased somewhat .
12,12 ADR

I learned from the pharmacist that this drug can cause wasting of muscles and that it was possible to end up in a wheelchair because of it ! !


I am going to start on alternative medicines .


I am never going to use this medicine again ! .


muscle weakness in ankle , plantar muscle , back .
0,2,5,6 ADR|0,2,8,8 ADR|0,3 ADR

I stopped lipitor right away when a friend told me that her supposedly ' fibromyalgia ' disappeared when she stopped the drugs .


Too many people with disabilitating symptoms taking lipitor or all the other cholesterol prescribed drugs .


It did lower my cholesterol but I don ' t need to be cripple .


Now I eat soaked oatmeal , 1 glass or dry red wine x 4 weekly , watch my diet , walk 1 / 2 hour daily .


It does lower my cholesterol from 300 to 175 I stopped it for 1 month my cholesterol went up again .


I suggest people with high cholesterol to research more about all cholesterol lowering drugs .


They all have the same formula with different names .


Find alternatives like me .


go natural .

I believe it is totally unnecessary for healthy people .


We NEED cholesterol .


In trying to reduce it , statins stop a whole cascade of addditional enzymes and proteins that are absolutely necessary for healthy bodies .


It took three years of statins ( 2 on Zocor then 1 one on Lipitor ) at 40 mg per day to finally cause the above reactions to the destruction the stains were doing to my body .


Terrible pain in hips and shoulders .
0,2,5,5 ADR|0,3 ADR

After taking Lipitor for a year , I started having pain in my hip .

The pain is so bad at this point that it wakes me up at night and extremely limits the use of my arms .
1,1,4,4 ADR|16,22 ADR

Dr sent me for x - rays , MRI , to see an orthopedic surgeon .


All results negative .


They suggested it could be tendonitis or avascular necrosis and recommended anti - inflammatories .


Nobody ever suggested it could be the drug until I found this site doing research on my pain .
17,17 ADR

It makes me wonder how powerful these drug companies are that doctors won ' t even suggest that the drug could be the problem .


I ' m stopping this drug today in the hopes that the pain goes away .
12,12 ADR

Hopefully I ' ll be able to play catch with my boys and swing a golf club again some day .

15,16 ADR|18,19 ADR

He switched to Pravachol 20 mg .


I lasted about 2 weeks .


The pain was worse .


Then I decided to look on the internet to find out what was causing the pain .


It was Statin .


I looked that up and found what it does to the body .


So , I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q 10 to build my body back up .


Two months later went back on Lipitor with the Q 10 .


2 months later , the pain was back .
5,5 ADR

Twice as bad as before , plus a whole bunch of other side effects , you see I ' m seriuosly allergic to the Statin .


And I know now , why I should have known this , but no one told me about it .


When you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically .


When ever I drank , sipped a little wine , by body hurt so bad , I thought I had the flu .


And no Aleve , or pain killer would help .


I thought I was allergic to the alcohol .


But now I know it was the Statin .


Here are a list of the side - effects I had , that started slowly and in two years , became unbearable : Insomina , abnoraml dreams , depression , memory loss , photosensitivity , muscle pain , leg cramps , rhinitis , bronchitis , asthma , dry skin , tinnitus ( left ear ) taste loss , dry eyes , weight gain and finally hypertension .

That night my body aches were so bad , I could hardly stand it .


Then two days later I came down with bronhitis , and asthma .

I ' ve gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem .


He said , no .


There is no warning on the prescription bottle , to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol .


The Dr is now doing tests , to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles .


I also , asked for physical theraphy for my left shoulder and neck .


My left shoulder is almost immobile .
1,5 ADR

I think the tinnitus in my left ear has been caused by the Lipitor .

Even so , the rash continued to enlarge and get worse , so I was forced to stop taking the Lipitor .

HORRIBLE GAS AND CONSTIPATION .
0,1 ADR|3,3 ADR

My trigycerides and cholesterol were all normal and healhty ranges , before taking Lipitor .

After 3 months , My trigycerides and total cholesteral went down , even though they were fine to begin with , but my CRP level went UP ! ! !


From 5 . 96 to 13 . 2 ! !


Since treating the CRP levels was the initial purpose in prescribing me Lipitor , and since it did NOTHING to help these levels , I am therefore unsure if taking LIPITOR for high C - reactive protein levels is necessary , let alone effective .


I can ' t deal with this gas much longer .

Yes , it did a great job lowering my cholesterol , but the side effects are very dangerous and I would think long and hard before taking any statin .

EXTREME EXHAUSTION .
0,1 ADR

It was bad enough that I unknowingly ramped up on LIPITOR and had to suffer those side effects but I was also as a result cold turkey on my anti - depressant so I had to endure its nasty cold turkey withdrawal symptoms .


I know that for two weeks I could only work a half day before I HAD to go home and PASS OUT .


Then I took another week for vacation .


Went to the doc after the first two weeks of the torment but EVERYTHING checked good cause we didn ' t know about the Lexapro / Lipitor swap .


I felt like a hypochondriac but I knew the bone deep aches were not my imagination .

12,16 ADR

Doctor gave me a prescription for a year ' s worth of Lipitor .


I took it for four months and asked for a retest before renewing my prescription .


In four months , my cholesterol dropped 100 points , HDL and LDL were in better , though not perfect balance .


With my cholesterol at 139 , I declined to take more Lipitor .


Got HDL and LDL into perfect balance within another two months using certain over - the - counter amino acids , tocotrienols , and other nutrients I found online that supposedly do the job .


They do !


And the nice thing is , if my cholesterol goes up again , I know that very low dose of Lipitor will take care of it .

I notice a poster attributed Bell ' s palsy to lipitor .


I too had Bell ' s , I went back and looked at my cholesterol chart and found I got Bell ' s before I started on lipitor .


There seems to be a consistent occurence of muscle pain and / or liver problems but I wonder how many other problems are not really attributable to lipitor eg see my Bell ' s palsy .


Also I get night muscle cramps but I have had occasional muscle cramps at night since I was a child , Maybe my memory isn ' t as good as it was but I ' m 70 and I still passed one of the hardest bar exams in the country less than 2 years ago .

Help ! !


Anyone else having these problems ? .


It concerns me that someone else is recommending SIMVISTATIN as an alternative to LIPITOR .


Up until 3 weeks ago I was taking LIPEX which is SIMVISTATIN - it reduced my cholesterol very satisfactorily .


However - over time , the following symptoms developed - pain in hips cannot walk even a short distance due to pain .
10,12 ADR|13,21 ADR

Legs felt like they had run a marathon !

Exhaustion .
0,0 ADR

A colleague asked if I was on cholesterol medication and informed me there could be a connection - I found this website - amazed at all the similarities to me - I thought I was going MAD ! ! !


I came of LIPEX 3 weeks ago , muscles feel better , energy levels picking up , but hip pain still throbbing .
18,19 ADR

I also felt like an old woman , I have over the years been to physiotherapists and chiropractors who did not know what to do - recently diagnosed with bursitis in the hips had 2 cortizone injections - still suffering severe hip pain and cannot walk more than 5 yards .
2,6 ADR|40,42 ADR|44,49 ADR

Doctor agreed I could be having severe side effects of STATIN drug - has insisted I need my cholesterol attended to - has now put me on BEZALIP ( no relation to STATINS so I am told ) I haven ' t filled the script yet - need to do more research .


My heart goes out to all of you ! .


very very blurry vision , at times felt that I ' m going blind , severe muscle pain , dizziness , and migrane headaches .
0,3 ADR|5,13 ADR|15,17 ADR|19,19 ADR|22,23 ADR

had to make another entry as i wanted to change the length of medicine taken from 1 day to 1 month as this was a typo on my part .


general weakness , decreased stamina .

This has been to date the only medicine to relieve my hip pain , but it ' s affecting my quality of life .


Who wants to have their period all month long and be non - stop nauseous ? !
5,8 ADR|14,14 ADR

If they ever fix the kinks I ' ll be the first in line , but at this point I don ' t consider this a safe medication .


It seems as if bleeding forever is a side effect but doctors tell you that its not the drug

Started taking an herbal cholesterol formula by Dr Sinatra and eating oatmeal everyday .


8 weeks after stopping lipitor was retested and cholesterol dropped to 255 .


obviously not from lipitor but from changes in diet and supplements .

0,1 ADR|3,4 ADR|6,6 ADR|8,8 ADR|10,12 ADR|14,14 ADR

I have stopped this medication a couple of times and my doctor keeps insisting I take it , rather then alternative medications .


I ' m getting off of this stuff after reading so many people are having similiar side - effects .


Doctors need this information ! .


8 hours after taken voltaren , I had a severe allergic reaction .
10,11 ADR

My skin felt like it was moving , and the itch on my head , genitals and lips was excruciating .
1,6 ADR|10,13 ADR|15,17,19,19 ADR

My lips started to swell , then my tongue .
1,4 ADR

Luckily I had an epipen in the medicine cupboard , and that saved me .


I had taken this medication many times before for gout and a bit of arthritis .


This was the first time I had the reaction .


I am now severely allergic to NSAIDs .


I feel fine while I am on it .


No side effects .


My Cholesterol went up after a couple day without it .


I had my blood work and the cholesterol is 291 .


I have Hypercholesterolemia .


Since taking the smaller round tablet I have been having leg cramps .
10,11 ADR

I have confirmed this by not taking for two days at a time then taking them .


Usually the cramps start that night after resuming the new smaller tablet .
2,2 ADR

My guess is there has been a change in method of manufacture or supplier .


I will seek out a natural way to reduce my cholesterol .


By the blood test results this drug does not increase my HDL , both HDL and LDL readings are less than 2 .


Australia and New Zealand measurement .


mostly i suffer restless leg syndrom 30 min . into taking it .
3,5 ADR

otherwise , first dose i felt better .


be careful if you ' re on lipitor and your doctor begins to try and put you on medications for high triglycerides .


i was put on tricor and it was extraordinarily horrible .


side effects you can ' t believe .


we summerized it as a conflict between the lipitor and tricor .


if you must take another med for triglycerides and you begin to feel flu like , cramps in chest , legs , rashes appear , sleep very heavily , sleep alot or feel fatigued consider keeping tabs and if the side effects don ' t improve or there ' s more added in 2 weeks time , discontinue doseage .


side effects may increase IE : gums swelling , visual anomalies , numbness in muscles , sore throat , soreness in mucous membrane areas .


I ' ve been taking Liptor for about a year with no major side effects , but recently I have been experiencing a sore , tingly tongue ( Glossitis ) and have ruled out everything from toothpaste to spicy foods .
23,29 ADR

I have also had dizzy spells , headaches , and trouble sleeping .
4,5 ADR|7,7 ADR|10,11 ADR

Doctor told me to discontinue Lipitor which I just did a couple days ago and I should know in a month or so if this is the cause ( glossitis and other symptoms are listed as possible side effects , although in my case it ' s been a delayed reaction )
29,29 ADR

Lipitor did bring my cholesterol down from 268 to 153 but I want the glossitis , headaches and dizziness to go away .
14,14 ADR|16,16 ADR|18,18 ADR

I hate feeling this way .


I will find another way to control my cholesterol if Lipitor proves to be the culprit .

0,9 ADR|11,11 ADR|13,14 ADR|18,19 ADR|16,16 ADR

It helped relieve the pain in my lower back but I would not recommend this to be used by women of any age .


Not quite sure what I will do now because I cannot take Bextra or Neurontin .


I guess go back to plain old advil and deal with it unless the doctor has another medication I can try .


Extreme muscle fatigue ( suspect Rhabdomyolosis ) leading to tendonitis as a result of trying to perform normal physical work related duties .
0,2 ADR|9,9 ADR

Just starting to regain strength after 16 months .


Very upset that Doctor prescribed Lipitor after being informed about eye muscle problems with Zocor .


No discussion of diet or possible side - effects , just here take these pills .


I was prescribed this drug because I had spent a whole night in complete agony ; abdominal pain , lower back pain , all that I imagine labor pain to be , except I was not in labor .


Though the cause of my pain remains undetermined , the Arthrotec combined with Paracetamol pretty much eliminated the pain .


This was a big relief , as the 1200 MG of Ibuprofen I had taken throughout the night had done nothing .


I only took 1 Arthrotec and 1 Paracetamol and that did the trick .


HOWEVER : I had a very bad headache yesterday and Ibuprofen again didn ' t work .
7,7 ADR

I still had the other Arthrotec pills left , so I took one .


Although it alleviated the pain , I got up this morning with heavy vaginal bleeding even though my period ended last week .
12,14 ADR

I was relieved to read that this could be a side effect , as it means I probably don ' t have something serious , but I will have to be in some serious pain to risk bleeding from the vagina again .


Next time I ' ll try my luck with Paracetamol .


The pill I took consisted of 50 MG Diclofenac and 200 MG Misoprostol .


Severe headaches .

Dr wanted me to take 40 mg per day and I said no .


I would try the 20 mg .


I am sensitive to medication .


I was told to stop for a week and call back if my symptoms stop .


I don ' t know if I want to take even a lower dosage .


It helps relieve chronic pain but over time , causes intestinal pain and bleeding .
10,11 ADR|13,13 ADR

I had symptoms similar to diverticulitis : blood in stool , pain .
7,9 ADR|11,11 ADR

I would be cautious about paying attention to cramping , intestinal / stomach pain which can lead to very serious conditions .

Extreme tiredness , dizziness , memory loss , moody .
0,1 ADR|3,3 ADR|5,6 ADR|8,8 ADR

Extreme muscle weakness and thinking problems .
0,2 ADR|4,5 ADR

This has gone on for 2 years now and is not getting straightened out .


I would not advise any body to take Lipitor unless their cholesterol is over 300 and then only with extreme close care by the physician .


Physicians should study the drugs they give their patients instead of just taking the pharmacy salesmen word for it .


Sudden knee pain 2 week into it , horriable crippeling pain hit both knees at same moment , progressed to odd painful , lumpy swelling on both feet in same place on each and a sudden horriable grabbing pain in one ankle , gas , indigestion , acid reflux , no energy , confusion , stumbeling , vertigo , memory loss , frequent sudden urges to go pee that came out with a force that sprayed everywhere .

Getting off cleared most up but woke up every morning with horriable pain in a different joint making it useless until it passed days later and suddenly landed in right shoulder .

0,4 ADR

HORRIABLE pain that almost throws me down .

Also my last colonscopy turned up 5 precancerous polyups .


Before statin drugs , I never had a one of them , 5 year .


This medicine is posion !


We do not know if the damage it does to us is permenant or not .


I feel like I have been cheated out of growing old naturally and will question every ailmant I have from now on as natural or statin induced .


In my whole life , I didn ' t see a doctor as much as I have since I started Lipitor drugs and since I have been off of it .


The doctor always brushed off my complaints or would write me a RX for another dangerous drug !


WHEN are doctors going to listen to the people are paying him to treat them and quit believing those who PROFIT from the sale of their drugs they push on unsuspecting people .


( What happened to DO NO HARM ? ) .


They have killed my faith in drugs , doctors and the FDA .


DOCTORS !


WAKE UP ! !


THEY ARE MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE FOOLS AND IDIOTS that can be bought for a free lunch or a plate of cookies !


I also say , get those darn drug ads OFF of TV ! .


Definitely short term memory issues , but I ' m 44 and I suppose it could be part of menopause on its way .
1,4 ADR

lowered overall cholesterol and my hdl went up to 59 from 35 , and triglycerides went down but not enough .


LDL down too but not enough so taking higher dose now .

I felt horrible & made an appointment with DOC .


Thought it might be gout , but found this website .


I quit taking the crap before my appointment with DOC .


The nurse told me " we have a lot of people who complain about pain " .
14,14 ADR

DOC understood and has kept me off Statins .


I wish those who take this stuff successfully the best , but for those of us who have adverse effects this can be deviating .


It took me 3 - 4 weeks to fully recover .


MD ' s need to take their patients reports about Lipitor seriously .


I would rater drink gasoline than take this stuff again ! .


I have to wonder if the effects of this Med are being downplayed by the powers that be .

5,6 ADR|8,9 ADR|11,11 ADR|13,15 ADR|18,18 ADR

21,25 ADR|37,40 ADR

After consulting with my doctor he told me to stop taking Lipitor until the pain went away and to start taking it after the pain was gone .
14,14 ADR|24,24 ADR

I followed the doctor ' s order .


After a few more months of taking Lipitor I began to develop severe pain in the muscles in the shoulder area , upper back and neck , the pain and stiffness of my neck was so bad that sometimes I couldn ' t even turn my head when I was driving .
12,20 ADR|12,15,22,23 ADR|12,15,25,25 ADR|28,28,33,33 ADR|30,30,33,33 ADR

I went to my doctor and she thought it was stress .


I took off work for a month and during this time I tried to relax and the pain did not go away .


I decided to be off Lipitor on my own and within a couple of weeks , the pain and stiffness from the neck and pain in the shoulder and back is going away , I feel much better now that I am not taking Lipitor .
17,17,22,22 ADR|19,19,22,22 ADR|24,27 ADR|24,26,29,29 ADR

0,1 ADR|3,3 ADR|5,9 ADR|11,12 ADR|14,15 ADR

My doctor kept changing the dosage , tried Mevacor and Gemfibrozil , as well .


This went on much too long , mostly due to my inability to make decisions due to statin ' s brain - draining effects .

After nearly committing suicide due to statin - induced depression , I stopped all statin meds .

My depression lifted quickly , panic attacks stopped , my hair started growing back .

Web searches turned up information indicating that women probably shouldn ' t be taking statins , especially older women .


I ' m lucky to be alive and will do everything I can to spread the word about this killer drug .


after visiting this site it is like looking into a mirrow .


i have had most of the problems many are having , infact it is 4 am can not sleep for just turning in bed is painful .

decided to do a little research on LIPITOR it has dropped cholosterol from 395 to 187 and tri from 1100 to 300 but i wounder if it worth the side - effects .


before medication had mild heart attack was put on lipitor , at first i felt good but now back pain and tiredness is at a high level , my wife complains that i need exercise but she does not understand i hurt just as much now as i did with the heart attack , i guess it all boils down to if i could get some rest , but seems impossible for just moving in bed is painful .

1,1 ADR|3,5 ADR|7,8 ADR|10,10 ADR|12,12 ADR|14,15 ADR

Finally went off all statins when I experienced a particularly bad reaction when the doctor , with a gleam in his eye , recommended combining lipitor with Zetia .


The results were so bad in terms of side - effects that I ceased all statins and discontinued the Zetia in short order .


I now take no statins , no Zetia .


Individually they have their own problems ; combined they are extremely dangerous and , in my opinion , should be banned as a combination therapy .


Probably safe in short doses , a very bad candidate for long - term use unless closely monitored and used in lowest possible safe doseage .


Would warn other patients to NOT COMBINE LIPITOR OR OTHER STATIN WITH Zetia , a common tactic that you will most likely regret .


Let the pharmaceutical reps take the meds they peddle and get them off the street , instead of handing out free clocks , watches , and vacations to cowboy - style doctors who are little less than drug - pushers .


muscles aches specially in back of legs , memory weakened , fatigue , lack of sexual drive , and more recently muscle inflamation in my shoulder and upper arm , taking medication for it .

I take zoloft for major depression and it works well .


However , within days of starting lipitor , I started feeling the adverse side effects Depression , anxiety , spaced - out feeling , lack of concentration , insomnia which are pretty much how I felt when I was experiencing major depression .
15,15 ADR|17,17 ADR|19,22 ADR|24,26 ADR|28,28 ADR

The thing is , if I were to stop taking zoloft today , it would be months before I felt the depression returning , and it would take months to get back to normal when I restarted zoloft .


Lipitor put me in that state in a could of weeks , and after stopping lipitor , I was feeling better in a few days .

The question is .


is lipitor causing this ?


I am taking 20 mg a day and have been taking this for 6 years .


This has been a huge problem for the last 2 . 5 years .


I read this website and feel that lipitor is causing my pain .
11,11 ADR

I have been to numberous orthopods , rheumetoligists , neouroligist , and others who cannot find any problems .


So , when I read about all these people who seem to have figured this out .


I have hope .


But are they correct in thier assumptions ?


We are all desperate to find an answer ( the cause ) and ultimately a cure .


But is lipitor the answer ?


That is the question ( DP 2 / 02 / 06 .

This drug needs to be taken off the market and doctors need to realize how much damage it has done to many innocent people .


I had been taking two tablets per day ( one @ breakfast time , the other @ dinner time ) for a couple of years when I was alerted to possible long term side effects & then consulted my GP who advised because of the time I had been taking them to only take them on a " need to basis " .


I immediately stopped completely but found that I had muscular pains all over my body , I have now reduced my intake to one per day @ breakfast time & find that this has proved a moderately succesful outcome .


Had 1 pill only 10 mg lipitor ( had tried lipex ( 2 pills ) 1 st but face had swollen up - cleared 2 weeks ) anyway the next morning - after sitting down for 10 minutes - i stood up to walk and it was a very painful and a very slow stooped debilatating ( compressed back ) type of walk but after 5 - 10 minutes of standing could straighten back - only problem when sitting down - lower back .
43,43,46,53 ADR

no other part of back a problem - can play tennis with only slight pain if bending over .


it is now 14 days and still same problem - tend to stand or lie down for computor work no other side affects that im aware of .


Will see doctor if it continues to be a problem in 1 week though i see some have continued to have problems even after stopping and after reading this blog i am swayed to think that it is a degenative muscle problem ( which will heal in time due to 1 pill only usage ) and may not be other internal organ reactions as i 1 st suspected .

I kept taking myself off this drug , was told it COULD NOT BE TH E DRUG , urged to go back on , recovering somewhat each time , but finally the damage was not reversible .


Today , I live with Lipitor and ( other statins ) injury which affects my ability to work , and I continue to try to recover .


After long and only partial recovery from Lipitor I took two other statins with similar response .


My cholesterol level is over 480 .


I have no cardiovascular disease , and see that according to this evidence based medicine source , there is NO evidence for statins in women for prevention .


Do statins have a role in primary prevention ?


NO !


http : / / www . ti . ubc . ca / pages / letter 48 . htm # comment


A question to us about Letter # 48 : What is the evidence of benefit for primary prevention in women ?


There were 10 , 990 women in the primary prevention trials ( 28 % of the total ) .


Only coronary events were reported for women , but when these were pooled they were not reduced by statin therapy , RR 0 . 98 [ 0 . 85 - 1 . 12 ] .


Thus the coronary benefit in primary prevention trials appears to be limited to men , RR 0 . 74 [ 0 . 68 - 0 . 81 ] , ARR 2 . 0 % , NNT 50 for 3 to 5 years .

Before taking Lipitor I never have leg cramps .
6,7 ADR

I then called my doctor and told him about my leg cramps and told me to stop taking the Lipitor and he was going to prescribe another drug .
10,11 ADR

After one week off the drug I still have severn leg cramps and went in for another doctors visit and he said he didn ' t thiink it was a Lipitor side effect because the cramps were localized and felt maybe the cramps were caused by a muscle enemze .
9,11 ADR|35,35 ADR|42,42 ADR

About the same time I got the leg cramps my right knee swelled up so I saw another doctor and I don ' t know if the knee and leg cramps are related side effects .

44,45 ADR

ZETIA ONLY HELPS WITH FOOD INDUCED CHOLESTEROL SO IS OF NO USE TO ME .

IT SEEMS THAT ' S JUST WHAT THE FDA WANTS US TO DO .


At first I had muscle pain , but that faded out .

Next effect was short term memory : I would gas up , then try to pay without hanging up the pump .
3,5 ADR

When I not only paid someone ' s bill but also drove off WITHOUT HANGING UP THE PUMP , I stopped taking the drug .


While it did lower my Cholesterol numbers ( as did Simvastatin afterwards ) , I ' m not sure it was worth it .


Especially when I forget something important to my job and which I should have overlearned from years of gassing up cars .


Memory is one of the things that cholesterol is used for making , and to me anything that cuts it off is best avoided .


Just before this last Christmas I had a small stroke and spent three days in the hospital .


To make a long story short , there are no after effects of the stroke .

On a pain scale it has gone from a 1 or 2 to 7 or 8 .
2,2 ADR

I have a followup apointment with my Doctor in two days and was thinking of asking him if I could go off the Lipitor .


What do you think ? .


At the beginning I didn ' t experience any side effects at all on 10 mg .


It did lower my cholesterol .
