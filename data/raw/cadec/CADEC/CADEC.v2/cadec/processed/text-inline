Document: LIPITOR.382
The inquest verdict was misadventure .


Document: LIPITOR.382
The GMC decided that the 20 mg dose was reasonable , and that the GP had not acted inappropriately by prescribing this dose .


Document: LIPITOR.382
So much for SPCs , PILs , and the CSM ' s Pharmacovigilance reports , all of which state that the usual dose is 10 mg a day , and that statins should be used with caution by patients over 70 and with hypothyroidism .

GPs will continue overprescribing if they are allowed to get away with it .

You completely destroy your metabolism absorbing chemicals .


Document: LIPITOR.878
Now I stopped all that and I am going the NATURAL way with good results .


Document: LIPITOR.878
I recommend acupuncture , homeopathy , natural supplements ( I highly recommend Apple Cider Vinegar and raw honey , those made my blood pressure go down by 30 points ! ) , good nutrition and exercise are much better and you will not enrich those pharmaceutical companies which are after your money , just trying to erase the symptoms but NOT the cause .

I am the advocate for my father who took this drug for 8 months before he passed from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2005 .


Document: LIPITOR.972
The patient data is reported for him by me .


Document: LIPITOR.972
Briefly , my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer ( glial cell related cancer ) .

My father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old , had great cholesterol numbers , but he was a cardiac patient .


Document: LIPITOR.972
He and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 ( his lipid profile was very , very good by usual medical standards ) .


Document: LIPITOR.972
I will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen ( my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father ' s work history experience ) , but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this .


Document: LIPITOR.972
My father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a totally normal guy walking with a cane from initial neurological damage at inital dx for brain cancer to bedridden , unable to speak , feed himself , do anything for himself in 10 days .

Document: FLECTOR.1
Started experiencing pain in my right heel when walking in mid - November ; it got worse over time so I went to see my orthopedist in early December and he said I had plantar fasciitis ; he showed me stretching exercises and advised me to get inserts for my walking shoes , wear cushioned house slippers and avoid walking up inclines .


Document: FLECTOR.1
The pain lessened by following all these recommendations but I was still uncomfortable a lot of the time .


Document: FLECTOR.1
I finally went to see the orthopedist in March and he said my foot " can " improve if I continued with the exercises , etc At the very end , he asked if he had given me the " patch " at my first appointment ; so I left with a sample and a prescription for the Flector patch .


Document: FLECTOR.1
I cut a patch ( there are five in each reclosable pouch ) in half and it covers the heel area .


Document: FLECTOR.1
After I used it the first time , the puffiness and pain were gone !


Document: FLECTOR.1
I found it best to use the patch at night only although you can replace it every 12 hours .


Document: FLECTOR.1
I put the patch on at bedtime , tape the edges down and wear a sock to secure it .


Document: FLECTOR.1
Initially , I used it every night and after about three weeks , was able to cut down to several times a week .

With a medical background , I know that cardiac symptoms are mistaken for gastric reasons so I went to the ER .


Document: VOLTAREN-XR.3
Long story short , I was diagnosed with severe gastric distress ( GERD ) and with a " gastric cocktail " and a high octane prilosec , I had some serious relief and sent home .


Document: VOLTAREN-XR.3
Not convinced it was the issue , I went a day without the RX and then started again .


Document: VOLTAREN-XR.3
I wasn ' t entirely 100 % after taking the dose and now , I am fairly certain it was the Voltaren .

Document: LIPITOR.112
I went to see my doctor and told him about my discovery .


Document: LIPITOR.112
First he was a bit reluctant but in the following meeting he already told me that he had read about Lipitor ' s psychiatric side effects .


Document: LIPITOR.112
He therefore put me off Lipitor completely and suggested a much lower dosage of 10 mg Crestor .


Document: LIPITOR.112
In addition , he prescribed a new medication : Niacin , beginning with 500 mg the first month and then increasing to 1 , 000 in the second ( with the ultimate aim of reaching 2 , 000 in the fourth monthly ) .


Document: LIPITOR.112
Bottom line : When I discontinued Lipitor two months ago my LDL reached 165 .


Document: LIPITOR.112
This week my blood test indicated an LDL level of 124 .


Document: LIPITOR.112
So , after being helped by folks on this website I hope I can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects .


Document: LIPITOR.112
Therefore , here is what I ' ve done during the past two months : - Took 500 mg of Niacin during the first months and 1 , 000 mg during the second ; - Took a total of 10 Crestor pills ( 10 mg which are equivalent to 20 mg of Lipitor ) per month , i . e . , one every three days .


Document: LIPITOR.112
- Two natural pills of Phytosterol .


Document: LIPITOR.112
- A cup of tea made of olive leafs .


Document: LIPITOR.112
Now , I do believe that when I reach the maximum intake of Niacin in two months ( 2 , 000 mg ) the LDL will drop from 124 to 100 ( the level required for diabetics ) .


Document: LIPITOR.112
Good luck , folks ! .

I did not experience any , but only took 1 tab once a day for two days .


Document: VOLTAREN.20
I found that Voltaren took away all my pain , i rarely use pain relief because i find it never helps or takes too long to take affect and just " soldier on " .


Document: VOLTAREN.20
As i am only young and relatively healthy i did not experience any side effects .


Document: VOLTAREN.20
HOWEVER my parents both have had bad side effects .


Document: VOLTAREN.20
so i dont recommend it if you suffer from High blood pressure , IBS , are prone to stomache ulcers , prone to reflux , heart burn or are an asthmatic .


Document: VOLTAREN.20
Otherwise if like me you are healthy and just need pain relief when nothing else will cut it just take one a day , and dont stay on them .


Document: VOLTAREN.20
the chances of getting side effects seem to increase according to the length of time you continue using them ( like most drugs ) and the effectiveness of the pain relief can also wear off over time .

I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped .

My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled .

My doctor , when I told him of all this , wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol .


Document: LIPITOR.780
I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zetia , which he said was was less effective but was not a statin , which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor .


Document: LIPITOR.780
He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said , well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect , but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed .


Document: LIPITOR.780
I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up !

Lipitor !

I have since changed doctors because my doctor told me he did not believe it was the lipitor since it should have affected me on both arms and hands , but as soon as I stopped the lipitor I stated to feel better , it has been three weeks now I still have some pain in muscles , but severe fatigue is gone , Problem now is my new doctor is suggesting Pravachol !

Grapefruit juice blocks the action of an enzyme that clears your bllodstream of the drug .

Document: LIPITOR.278
diet made virtually NO difference to my count .


Document: LIPITOR.278
So I went onto Zocor ( new - ish then ) and remained on it for 21 years , finally on a dose of 40 mg / day with no real side effects - it lowered my count to 5 . 6 mmol / L .


Document: LIPITOR.278
As my count started to rise again to 7 . 8 in 1997 ( at age 48 ) , I switched to Lipitor , starting with 20 mg / day and then 40 mg / day which dropped my count A LOT to just 5 . 1 mmol / L and with an HDL ' good cholesterol ' count of 1 . 6 .


Document: LIPITOR.278
After a 3 - week holiday without pills , my count rose to 10 . 4 , so I went back onto 40 mg / day of Lipitor - but my count was still only 6 . 7 , so I put myself onto 80 mg / day Lipitor and my count went down to 5 . 5 - this is the highest dose recommended .

Another serious side effect of Lipitor and other statins is a condition called rhabdomyolysis , in which muscle cells break down and release potentially toxic cell contents into the bloodstream . ,


Document: LIPITOR.787
Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain , tenderness and weakness - - most commonly in the calves and lower back .


Document: LIPITOR.787
Malaise , fever , dark urine , vomiting and nausea can also be symptoms .

It was Statin .


Document: LIPITOR.546
I looked that up and found what it does to the body .


Document: LIPITOR.546
So , I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q 10 to build my body back up .

Two months later went back on Lipitor with the Q 10 .

2 months later , the pain was back .

When you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically .

When ever I drank , sipped a little wine , by body hurt so bad , I thought I had the flu .


Document: LIPITOR.546
And no Aleve , or pain killer would help .

I thought I was allergic to the alcohol .

I too had Bell ' s , I went back and looked at my cholesterol chart and found I got Bell ' s before I started on lipitor .


Document: LIPITOR.374
There seems to be a consistent occurence of muscle pain and / or liver problems but I wonder how many other problems are not really attributable to lipitor eg see my Bell ' s palsy .


Document: LIPITOR.374
Also I get night muscle cramps but I have had occasional muscle cramps at night since I was a child , Maybe my memory isn ' t as good as it was but I ' m 70 and I still passed one of the hardest bar exams in the country less than 2 years ago .

I was prescribed this drug because I had spent a whole night in complete agony ; abdominal pain , lower back pain , all that I imagine labor pain to be , except I was not in labor .


Document: ARTHROTEC.16
Though the cause of my pain remains undetermined , the Arthrotec combined with Paracetamol pretty much eliminated the pain .


Document: ARTHROTEC.16
This was a big relief , as the 1200 MG of Ibuprofen I had taken throughout the night had done nothing .

I only took 1 Arthrotec and 1 Paracetamol and that did the trick .

Will see doctor if it continues to be a problem in 1 week though i see some have continued to have problems even after stopping and after reading this blog i am swayed to think that it is a degenative muscle problem ( which will heal in time due to 1 pill only usage ) and may not be other internal organ reactions as i 1 st suspected .

I STOPPED AND WAITED FOR A MONTH AND TRIED AGAIN ; THE SAME EFFECT ONLY WITHIN 48 HOURS .


Document: LIPITOR.195
I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH 3 OTHER STATIN DRUGS .


Document: LIPITOR.195
AFTER SEEING SO MUCH ABOUT THIS DRUG IN PERIODICALS AND SUCH , I WILL JUST HAVE TO TAKE MY CHANCES ON HEALTHY DIET ; MY CHOLESTEROL IS MOSTLY GENETIC SO I AM STUCK UNTIL THEY COME OUT WITH A DRUG THAT DOES NOT CAUSE JOINT PAIN .
44,45 ADR

Document: LIPITOR.195
ZETIA ONLY HELPS WITH FOOD INDUCED CHOLESTEROL SO IS OF NO USE TO ME .


Document: LIPITOR.195
AND I REFUSE TO TAKE A PILL TO COUNTERACAT THE SIDE EFFECTS OF ANOTHER PILL .


Document: LIPITOR.195

When I not only paid someone ' s bill but also drove off WITHOUT HANGING UP THE PUMP , I stopped taking the drug .


Document: LIPITOR.892
While it did lower my Cholesterol numbers ( as did Simvastatin afterwards ) , I ' m not sure it was worth it .


Document: LIPITOR.892
Especially when I forget something important to my job and which I should have overlearned from years of gassing up cars .


Document: LIPITOR.892
Memory is one of the things that cholesterol is used for making , and to me anything that cuts it off is best avoided .


Document: LIPITOR.201
Just before this last Christmas I had a small stroke and spent three days in the hospital .


Document: LIPITOR.201
To make a long story short , there are no after effects of the stroke .


Document: LIPITOR.201
In other words the symptoms went away .


Document: LIPITOR.201
But , my Doc put me on Aggrenox and 20 mg of Lipitor .


Document: LIPITOR.201
I have very high arches and have had a little tingling in my feet for years .
10,10 ADR

Document: LIPITOR.201
This is really helped with a good arch support .


Document: LIPITOR.201
But for the last two months the pain in my feet and calves ( and sometimes thigh ) has gotten much worse .
7,7 ADR

Document: LIPITOR.201
I cannot walk very far and sleeping has become a problem because of the pain .
1,2 ADR|14,14 ADR

Document: LIPITOR.201
Because of the preexisting arch problem , I thought it was just naturally getting worse but after finding this web site I am not sure if it is not the Lipitor .


Document: LIPITOR.201
On a pain scale it has gone from a 1 or 2 to 7 or 8 .
2,2 ADR

Document: LIPITOR.201
I have a followup apointment with my Doctor in two days and was thinking of asking him if I could go off the Lipitor .


Document: LIPITOR.201
What do you think ? .


Document: LIPITOR.120
At the beginning I didn ' t experience any side effects at all on 10 mg .

In my 11 th year I have now developed Tinnitus ( ringing in the ears ) as well as still all the above side effects .
9,9 ADR|11,14 ADR

Document: LIPITOR.120
When I did research I read that all of the side effects I am experiencing have most likely been cause from taking Lipitor for a long time .


Document: LIPITOR.120
I have now decided to stop taking Lipitor before something else happens to me .


Document: LIPITOR.120
Too bad all of this showed up after so many years .

I was originally taking 150 mg per day , but cut it to 100 mg because the lesser dose seemed to work as well .


Document: CATAFLAM.7
My internist had urged me to take Vioxx , Celebrx and Bextra ( at different times , of course ) , but the relief I experienced was not as dramatic as the Cataflam .


Document: CATAFLAM.7
My orthopaedic surgeon prescribes the Cataflam .


Document: CATAFLAM.7
It has a slight effect on my blood pressure , but , since my pressure is usually low , that is not considered a health risk .

I have not been takeing Lipitor very long it has only been a few weeks and my Dr has me taking it twice a week but since I have been taking it my right hand has been getting numb and hurting it feels like there is no circulation getting to it and after reading all of this it is probally the lipitor , I am very worried now after reading all of this and feel I should quit taking it .

This drug makes me so agitated - - insomnia , hideously increased muscle tension , short tempered , impatient .
5,5 ADR|10,13 ADR|15,16 ADR|8,8 ADR|18,18 ADR

It really helped with pain in hand & arm , but the agitation is unbearable .
12,12 ADR

Document: VOLTAREN.11
I got spasms in my back from it and had to get therapy for those .
2,5 ADR

Document: VOLTAREN.11
I know it doesn ' t make sense with the tiny dose I ' m taking , & they say no systemic effects from the topical gel , but I ' ve gone on & off it 4 or 5 times now and the effects when using it are unmistakeable .


Document: LIPITOR.177
I ' m not sure if this is related to the lipitor , but shortly after I started taking it , I exprienced complete paralysis in my forehead ( peripheral neuropathy ) .

Document: LIPITOR.177
Went to a neurologist , GP and ENT , none of whom have ever seen this kind of paralysis ( both sides ) with no other symptoms .
18,18 ADR

Document: LIPITOR.177
Has any one else come across this symptom ?


Document: LIPITOR.177
I m tempted to go off the medicine to see if the paralysis goes away .
12,12 ADR

Document: LIPITOR.177
It really lowered my cholestrol a lot , so I hope this problem isn ; t related .
